I agree with the paid ad campaign suggestion in the comment, basically become the media buyer and run the ad platform, but it requires a lot of time and investment and it's harder to convince people to take chance on a complete newbie with their money for ads. So either work under someone who's experienced, cuz u will learn it faster in a practical setting, message a top freelancer and offer to assist them in their work and in return you'll sit through their strategy discussion on how to choose creatives etc etc, it's a whole different area but within 3-4 months you'll be very much capable of landing your own clients.  \nStart on Fiverr or Upwork for the above.\n\nFor smaller side income while you build the main thing, survey and PTE apps can get you $200-250/month. I use Prolific and Babki. It's not much but it helps while you're ramping up the bigger income sources, and esp. with surveys once you get consistent and start getting invites to better surveys, it's a solid source of extra income for some people.\n\nAll in all pick one main skill to learn and freelance it. Don't try to do 10 different things at once or you won't get good at any of them.\n\nAlso it depends on things that you may naturally be good at, so spend time figuring that out",

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.",

          "body": "Okay I know this is going to sound so redundant but being established on survey apps and having a good freelance skill is still the best way to go about it. So I'll give you an example of what I do to make at least $300-500 a month, it's really random and not consistent but works for me.\n\nI use a bunch of survey and play to earn apps during downtime like commute or before bed. That gets me around $80-120 most months. I mainly use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games so I can switch when one gets boring. Also throw in some other random ones when I see signup bonuses.\n\nThen I do small freelance gigs on Fiverr for excel work mostly data entry or reorgnaization. Some months I get 2-3 gigs and make $200, other months nothing. It's inconsistent but when combined with the apps it usually lands somewhere in that $300-500 range.",

      "selftext": "Ninety days ago, I hit publish without a plan.\n\nNo niche.  \nNo funnel.  \nNo clear outcome.\n\nJust a promise to myself:\n\n**Write every day. Tell the truth. See what happens.**\n\nHere is what actually happened.\n\n\n\n## 1. Consistency Is the Real Differentiator\n\nIdeas are everywhere.  \nMotivation fades fast.\n\nShowing up every day is rare.\n\nMost newsletters die after five issues.  \nSome after ten.  \nAlmost none survive boredom.\n\nWriting daily forces momentum. Even bad days count. Especially bad days.\n\nMomentum compounds quietly.\n\n\n\n## 2. You Do Not Need a Niche to Start\n\nI wrote about:\n- Games  \n- Debt  \n- Kids  \n- AI  \n- Side hustles  \n- Being tired  \n- Being lost  \n\nPeople still subscribed.\n\nWhy? Because clarity comes later.  \nVoice comes first.\n\nYour niche finds you while you show up.\n\n\n\n## 3. Honesty Beats Polish Every Time\n\nThe most replies came from emails where I admitted:\n- I was stuck  \n- I was broke  \n- I did not know what to build next  \n- I was exhausted  \n\nPerfect writing gets skimmed.  \nHonest writing gets read.\n\nPeople do not connect with success.  \nThey connect with struggle in motion.\n\n\n## 4. Writing Creates Direction You Cannot Think Your Way Into\n\nBefore the newsletter, my head was noisy.\n\nToo many ideas.  \nToo many directions.\n\nWriting forced decisions.\n\nEvery sentence clarified what mattered.  \nEvery issue narrowed the signal.\n\nAction creates clarity. Not the other way around.\n\n\n## 5. You Learn What Resonates Only by Publishing\n\nI thought some topics would hit. They did nothing.\n\nI wrote throwaway thoughts that sparked replies, shares, and signups.\n\nYou cannot predict resonance from your head.\n\nYou discover it in public.\n\n\n\n## 6. Momentum Is Fragile. Protect It Aggressively\n\nSkipping one day feels harmless.\n\nIt is not.\n\nSkipping breaks the streak.  \nBreaking the streak kills momentum.  \nMomentum is everything.\n\nSome days I wrote at 3 AM.  \nSome days I wrote tired.  \nSome days I wrote with nothing interesting to say.\n\nThose days mattered most.\n\n\n\n## 7. Writing Builds Trust Before It Makes Money\n\nNinety days in, I did not get rich.\n\nBut something better happened.\n\nPeople trusted me.\n\nThey replied.  \nThey asked questions.  \nThey shared ideas.  \nThey followed my projects.\n\nTrust is the asset.  \nMoney follows trust.\n\n\n\n## 8. Your Life Is Content If You Pay Attention\n\nI stopped hunting for ideas.\n\nLife provided them.\n\n- A bike ride  \n- A sick kid  \n- A failed product  \n- A small win  \n- A bad day  \n\nYou do not need inspiration.  \nYou need awareness.\n\n\n## 9. Building in Public Keeps You Accountable\n\nWhen people expect tomorrow’s email, quitting gets harder.\n\nThat pressure is good.\n\nIt turned writing into a habit instead of a mood.\n\nAccountability creates endurance.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Ninety Days Is Just the Beginning\n\nNothing magical happens on day ninety.\n\nNo finish line.  \nNo sudden clarity.  \nNo overnight win.\n\nBut something shifts.\n\nWriting becomes normal.  \nSharing becomes easier.  \nConfidence grows quietly.\n\nYou stop asking, “Should I keep going?”\n\nYou just keep going.\n\nI don't plan on stopping. Look for another update in 90 days when I hit 180 days of writing a daily newsletter! \n\nComment below any questions i'll answer them all! \n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I have been doing web dev and now software for years ever since I was 15 and had to quite literally do door to door sales selling these services when my dad lost his job due to Covid in order to help out. \n\nI'm a college student now studying chemical engineering yet I make more money than my professors. \n\nI currently have 4 clients and I never had this many clients in the same time especially since they are high quality. \n\nRecently I lost my PayPal account with good money in it and couldn't recover so I had to start from square one because majority of my cash was there.\n\nLuckily I did have the sales experience and an exact plan on how to acquire some clients fast and hence after some tiring amount of outreach and posting ads even here on reddit, I found myself in an even better position than I was in before. \n\nAfter covering my debts and paying off those I outsourced to, now I'm left with 4 clients, all of which I will build the software/site for without subcontracting or outsourcing.\n\nThe planning, the Figma designing, the countless calls, the documents and contracts that I had to draft and sign, and the slouching behind my desk got my eyes dead and me stressed and constantly tired. \n\nI can't even socialize or want to. \n\nI am in my own world. I sleep randomly, wake up randomly whether at 2am or in the afternoon, and life is basically either laptop or bed. \n\nAnd this is all to ensure 100% client satisfaction. \n\nBecause I understand that building a strong relationship is the real goal and not the money. \n\nI've been doing this for a while anyway. \n\nBut this workload paired with exams coming up, even though I practically attend college for vibes at this point, and in general me being relatively young and already living alone at 20 is seriously driving me insane. \n\nWhen I heard entrepreneurs say that building and starting a business is hard, I never thought it could actually be THIS ridiculously hard. \n\nBut here I am wishing I was just some good boy who's only concern is his GPA. \n\nBut there's no going back now and I have no regrets. \n\nTo those that run a business solo... How do you do it? And how do you deal specifically with pressure and stress? \n\nThanks. ",

I basically would like to improve my life and the only way I can do. This is to accomplish large important projects and goals, but I cannot finish. I’ve been trying to do this for more than a year.\n\nI will give you some examples: \n\nIt’s really important for me to start a side business that will actually generate meaningful income. I have exact anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed as having major depression yet I force myself to work on these projects every day. in the past year I’ve tried to start two businesses. I spent roughly 4 to 5 months on each business and they are currently at the state of being about 90% ready to launch.  I have a problem finishing the other 10% so that they are ready to present to the public, advertise to obtain new users, and begin taking payments and generating income.  The reason for this is, I work so hard on these projects and I put everything into them and become obsessed with them over the period of 3 to 4 months but by the end of that timeframe I have lost faith in my original business idea and don’t feel like the ideas will be successful in the marketplace so I just pretty much finish the businesses from a technical implementation, but I never put the finishing touches and make the businesses available to the general public. Instead, I start a new business and the cycle repeats itself.  \n\nFor instance, I made a mobile app at work so hard on it to get it up and running, technically with backend website with payment and user accounts.  At the end of several months, the app is ready to launch, but I have lost faith in my original idea, and I have no confidence that will even make money. So I never launch, instead, I start a new business.  The next business is an AI startup, I spent several months learning and programming and getting everything ready for lunch. At the end of several months, I realize that I don’t like my original idea anymore and even though the business is about 90% ready for lunch, I never follow through and now I’m thinking of starting a new business with a different idea.\n\nHow can I break this pattern? I’m considering hiring an accountability coach who will check on me and give me encouragement so I actually follow through on these projects. Is this a good strategy or am I just not disciplined? any comments appreciated.  ",

          "body": "I saw you mentioned in another comment you're already in therapy which is good. This sounds less like a discipline problem and more like you're protecting yourself from potential failure by abandoning projects before they can actually fail in the real world. Getting to 90% means you can do the work, stopping at 90% means something else is blocking you.\n\nAn accountability coach might help with the practical side of actually launching but it won't fix the underlying fear that's making you lose faith in your ideas right before launch. That's the CPTSD pattern you mentioned and worth continuing to work on in therapy.\n\nOne thing that might help is launching imperfectly on purpose. Like set a hard deadline that the next project goes live at 80% ready instead of waiting for 90%. It won't be perfect but it'll break the pattern of never launching. You can always improve it after it's live.",

      "selftext": "Hi.. i'm a 16 year old and i guess i'm just writing this because i don't have anyone else to talk to. I go to school from 8am to 1 and after that my day is basically empty most of the time. Since the pandemic, my life hasn't really been interesting at all. I don't have any friends to hang out with or spend time with so i'm always just by myself. Most of my time goes into scrolling reels or randomly learning things online, mostly related to finance. Finance is one of the few things that genuinely interests me. Sometimes I just sit and think about money, businesses, how people make it, how systems work. I know that might sound weird for my age but that's just how it is.\n\nI tried flipping game accounts for almost 8 months. I didn't have any money to start with so I couldn't buy accounts and resell them. Instead I used to promote other people's resell accounts with their permission for a small commission or for a cheap account worth the commission. I actually did sell around 3-4 accounts but I never received my commission as the account owners eventually ghosted or straight up scammed me.\n\nAnother problem was that I didn't own the accounts. I didn't have the login ids or passwords so when buyers asked for proof I couldn't log in and show them which I completely understand from their side. Because of this I couldn't sell many accounts and after months of trying I ended up earning nothing.\n\nStill, one thing I can honestly say is that during those 8 months, I never scammed a single person. Even when I could have. Even when I was frustrated. That might sound small but it matters to me.\n\nRight now, I have a lot of free time and the thought of making money is always in my head. Not big money. Not some crazy income. Even a couple of dollars would mean a lot to me, just to know I can earn something on my own.\n\nSince I'm under 18, I don't have a bank account yet. I also don't want to use my parents' money or their bank accounts. I want whatever I earn to be completely mine. So I made a cryppto wallet to receive payments, and if I ever need to cash out, I transfer it to my cousin's wallet since he's above 18.\n\nMy parents don't even know I'm trying to do side hustles. I have always had this dream of surprising them one day with my first earnings no matter how small and gifting them something valuable with money I made myself.\n\nI'm not lazy. I'm not looking for shortcuts. I'm just.. lost. I have time and i'm willing to learn and I genuinely want to be financially independent even if it starts very small.\n\nIf anyone here understands my situation or has realistic side hustle ideas for someone my age with no capital, i would really appreciate your advice.\n\nThanks for reading this.",

      "selftext": "I live about 3 blocks from a concert venue and my house has this long driveway that fits 2 cars easy. Never really thought about it until my neighbor mentioned people always park on our street during events.\n\nStarted listing it on one of those parking apps back in April and honestly its been the easiest money ive ever made. I charge $20 per event (shows are like twice a week usually) and people book ahead. Payment is automatic, I dont have to do anything except make sure my own car isnt there on event nights.\n\nVenue charges $50 for their lot so my pricing works. Had maybe 3 situations where someone showed up late or parked like an idiot but overall pretty smooth. The app takes a cut but whatever, still making around $160 a month for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nNow ive got a bit of money sitting aside from Stаke and im trying to think if theres anything I could add to elevate the whole thing so I can start charging more. Like maybe some security cameras or better lighting or idk what else would make people willing to pay $25-30 instead.",

You already know your favorite retailer’s patterns. Patterns are important. If you have a retirement plan then you can see how they swing trade as well. Even drug dealers buy low and sell high.\n\n2. Sales - Learn to sell times right way. Power of persuasion is a valuable tool. Works a million times better when you are actually selling to folks with good intent. \n\n3. Learn to Earn - Lets make one fact clear: money does not exist. You must work for everything special and terrible in life. That’s part of the plan. The knowledge you take in and translate that to action is a major building block in your journey.\n\nWhen you’re out shopping, make sure to comb through the clearance section of every store you go to you. What can you resell? Plan trips for thrifting and garage sales. I still do that.\n\nThe process of you putting in the time planning and executing great strategies coupled with who you meet is priceless.\n\nWhen you go to a new town on vacation or just stopping by, place yourself as a person that is planning on moving there and speak to people. Actually listen to what they say, suggest, what they do for a living, etc… Build relationships. Travel as much as you can.\n\nI can go on and on since I have done so much in my life to create “passive income”.\n\nWork hard, and do it with great intent and you will make 80% of your adventures work out.\n\nWhen you see or come up with a new idea, attack it passionately to see if it will work. Don’t quit until you are forced to pivot meaning you maxed out your returns. Don’t just quit just to quit.",

          "body": "IMO, there isn’t really a single “skill” that leads to passive income. What works is learning how to package something you’re good at and getting it in front of the right people.\n\nThat “something” can sit anywhere on a spectrum:\n\n\t•Services (tutoring, proofreading, childcare) → more active, easier to start\n\n\t•Digital products (printables, templates) → create once, sell repeatedly\n\n\t•Content/affiliates → slower burn, more scalable\n\nServices usually require more hands-on effort, but they’re a great entry point. For example, tutoring or kids’ activities are best marketed in parent spaces — PTA groups, school newsletters, community boards, libraries, coffee shops near schools, etc.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I made cootie catchers out of flyers advertising myself as a mother’s helper and handed them out at our community pool. My mom shared them through PTA connections. That’s not advanced marketing — it’s just knowing where your audience already is and when they’re mentally open to noticing your offer.\n\nPrintables sit closer to the “passive” end. You create them once (worksheets, planners, kids’ activities) and sell them repeatedly on sites like Etsy. But it’s saturated, so discovery still matters. You don’t need to be a marketing expert — just understand the basics of SEO, algorithms, and when /your/ audience is active.\n\nIf you’re product- or lifestyle-focused (beauty, fashion, fitness, home), affiliate links (Amazon, LTK, “link in bio”) are another route. Same principle, different channel.\n\nThe closest thing to passive income comes after upfront effort: build once, market intentionally, then let systems and word of mouth take over.",

What is actually working for everyone else here because I am tired of seeing posts about dropshipping and amazon fba like those are passive when they are clearly not",

Most things require some maintenance work, but if you do them well then you can make a lot of money with a little bit of work, which is obviously better than a lot of money with a lot of work, or a little money with a lot of work.",

One is to invest money and two is to have a business that gives you money. \n\nAfter that sure there are several small ways here and there but you will find that in order to actually generate considerable income you would either have to spend money or make a business, or both.\n\nIf you have around 300k in stocks you could make around 90k every 3 years approximately which is around 10%, and that if the stocks make sense. I suppose you don’t have that money so what’s left is actually building a business that you could automate later on, but even then, the minute something goes wrong, it turns to active income.\n\nIn other words, you either have a capital upfront (stocks, property even, etc) and make money on returns or you either  build a business that holds value and lasts. To me everything else is scam or pennies at best.",

Same with YouTube or Shorts tied to a clear niche.\n\nAnother solid path is building or licensing something small but useful, like templates, scripts, prompts, Notion setups, or simple tools. You put the work in upfront, then sell it repeatedly. Even $10–$20 products don’t need many sales per day to hit that goal.\n\nReselling and arbitrage can work too, but it’s usually less passive and more operational.

      "selftext": "Over the last few years I tried pretty much every hustle you see on YouTube: Amazon FBA, low-content books, faceless YouTube, affiliate blogs, even a couple of drop-servicing sites. Made little spikes of income here and there, nothing sustainable, nothing I could confidently grow.\n\nWhat finally started working was treating one thing like an actual product business instead of a quick win. I’d been curious about SaaS but assumed it was too “serious” compared to easy hustles. The only reason I even tried was seeing a bunch of small, bootstrapped SaaS case studies in [foundertoolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) that started from where I was: no audience, no funding, just skills and time. The difference with this route was that the first dollars I made were from people paying monthly for something that actually solved a problem, not a one-off trick. I followed a validation and launch sequence I found there: weekend idea tests, pre-sell a tiny group, launch across 20+ small channels instead of only one big platform, then commit to a few months of content to keep traffic coming.\n\nMy first product is nothing crazy. It’s a simple niche tool solving one specific workflow headache. MRR is just over $1,200 right now, but psychologically it’s a different world from one-time hustles. Revenue comes in every month without having to constantly find new buyers from scratch. The biggest surprise was realizing I didn’t need some viral idea or massive audience, just a boring, well-executed system. Seeing dozens of people turn that system into $1–10K MRR made it feel less like a gamble and more like a skill I could learn. It’s still work, but it finally feels like I’m building an asset instead of chasing the next tactic.",

That’s the niche I chose, and it aligns well with my own experience.\n\nThe “passive” part comes from recurring commissions on monthly subscriptions (software, training, tools, etc.). Once systems are in place, income can repeat without starting from zero each month—though it still needs occasional optimization.\n\nTo make this work with limited time, I rely heavily on automation and AI tools to handle tasks I can’t do manually.\n\nAffiliate marketing itself isn’t niche-specific—you can apply the same model to almost any area, as long as it’s something you’re interested in and willing to learn.",

You could buy some of the cheaper books and up charge them when reselling. Like I saw a book online for $20, that cost $200 at like Walmart. As long as they are more affordable than the brand new copies, and you build a reputable reputation, people might pay more than the cheapest option if they know that they can trust the seller.\n\nYou could work with college students, because colleges tend to upcharge a crazier amount than regular stores. (Literally got my college to lower their textbook price by $200 just because a local store had it $200 cheaper.)

          "body": "If you need that exact amount quickly, the fastest path isn’t some shiny new idea. It’s stacking predictable, boring wins that already work.\n\nHere’s a realistic breakdown that doesn’t rely on luck or “going viral”:\n\n1. Sell a skill or task you can do today\nNot next month. Today.\nExamples that convert fast:\n\nSimple design (Canva thumbnails, resumes, IG posts)\n\nWriting (product descriptions, captions, rewriting AI text)\n\nTech help (website fixes, setup, basic automation)\n\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert. You need to solve one small problem and price it clearly.\n\n2. Price for speed, not perfection\n$100–$200 offers move faster than $10 ones.\n5 people paying $200 = you’re basically there.\n\nMost people fail because they underprice and overwork.\n\n3. Go where buyers already are (don’t “build an audience”)\n\nReddit (help-first replies, no pitching)\n\nFacebook groups\n\nTwitter/X replies\n\nLocal businesses that already spend money\n\n\nOne solid message to the right person beats 100 posts.\n\n4. Sell something digital once if you’re short on time If you can package knowledge you already have into:\n\na short guide\n\nchecklist\n\nstep-by-step system\n\n\nYou can sell it multiple times without extra work. This is how people hit very specific numbers fast.\n\nI struggled with the same “I need money now” pressure, so I wrote a short, practical guide breaking down:\n\nwhat actually converts fast\n\nhow to price so people say yes\n\nwhere to post without sounding salesy\n\n\nNot hype, just execution. If that sounds useful, it’s linked on my profile.\n\nEither way, focus on speed + clarity, not complexity. That’s how you hit $972 instead of chasing $9.72.",

I am on a fixed income (SSDI) and have had trouble even keeping a fast food job in the past because of how overwhelmed I kept getting. My girlfriend has health issues and can’t work either. We have had to earn extra income through DoorDash, but it’s not always available for us and income from that has dwindled. She drives and I just pick up the food and drop it off. I cannot drive because I am incredibly scared to, and the amount of reckless drivers in my city have put me off of even wanting to try to learn how to drive. \n\nI do have a really good PC that we got a while back which has the 12GB Nvidia RTX 5070, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of Storage space. I point this out because I figure there is something I can do with my PC. It’s powerful enough for image generation, RVC, and can even run some LLMs locally. My problem is that I do not know where to go or start. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche.\n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1.\t⁠start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n2.\t⁠once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n3.\t⁠once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course.\n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you.\n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

I’m nowhere near quitting my day job, but it’s solid extra income I can work on in my spare time while building a catalog of content that keeps selling.\n\nIt’s adult ebooks. NSFW. Turns out there’s real demand.\n\nI sell across multiple storefronts and slowly build a reader base that follows my work. About half of my process uses AI, but the other half is creativity and editing. If you rely only on AI, you get buried in low-quality content fast.\n\nThis is very niche, and most people don’t make much. But it is possible. From what I’ve seen, there are quite a few people doing very well in this space.\n\nI also sell custom stories. They take more work, even with partial AI assistance, but I’ve made almost $2,000 this year from just five of those commissions.\n\nEdit: I learned everything through authormeta.com (the Erotica Author QuickStart Guide)",

It’s usually work now, lighter work later.\n\nThat said, here are the most realistic options people actually make work:\n\nDigital products\nGuides, templates, checklists, simple tools. You do the work once, then improve it over time. Not instant, but repeatable.\n\nContent + affiliates\nWriting posts, answering questions, or making short content that links to tools you genuinely use. Slow at first, compounds later.\n\nRoyalties / licensing\nStock photos, music, designs, or assets. Very competitive, but low maintenance once uploaded.\n\nAutomation of an active skill\nTurning something you already do (freelancing, consulting, teaching) into a template, resource, or product.\n\n\nAnything that claims “fully passive with no effort” is usually just selling the idea, not the income.\n\nIn my experience, the closest thing to passive income comes from building something small that keeps working even when you’re not actively chasing people.\n\nCurious what others here consider “passive”.

          "body": "If anything, learn a hard skill/career that you can practice and make money solely on. Writing, video editing, digital marketing, web development. It's best to focus on one, but you will likely find yourself having to do other things around it, which does give a good platform for later on should you wish to go down those routes. \n\nStart with those and build around it, a lot of the less tangible skills will come through your own understanding and maturity. For instance, copywriting requires the ability to research, and also doing it to create your own understanding (especially now with AI lowering the bar a bit). \n\nI started with writing articles, and that led me into copywriting. I learned how SEO worked, how to monetise blogs and websites, how to communicate with potential clients. That's just one line of work, but it's just an example of how you can branch out your skills and insight the further you go. \n\nIt's better to start slow and steady as well with these, go into it with the idea of becoming good at what you do, rather than making money. The competition is massive online, but excelling and standing out is what gives longevity from my experience. Most of my opportunities have come from people seeing the quality of my work and the results, rather than me having to hard sell to them. \n\nAlso, you should consider attitudes more than anything. Be patient, put the effort in, don't make shortcuts and become resilient. It takes time to get anywhere reasonable, and you need to temper your expectations at times, but the success cut through eventually and that's what you need to focus on.\n\nEdit: Just realised this was the passive income sub, not the one I thought it was. A lot of this still rings true, but focus on a niche you're interested in and build something around that. You can practice skills easily, you will understand the market/industry/topic better and you will have an easier time getting the ball rolling.",

      "selftext": "I posted this to another sub and got some really good insights. I kind of wanted to see if anyone on this sub had something else to add.\n\nA few months ago, I started seeing some posts in my Instagram feed about the massive potential of making money EASILY by selling digital products (courses, PDFs, ebooks) and promoting them on Instagram. \n\nI wasn’t desperate for money or trying to escape a job I hated. I just thought it might be a reasonable way to bring in some extra income to help with my tuition. The way it was framed made it sound low effort and practical. I figured: what the hell? For a few hours a day, it seems lucrative enough.\n\nI also didn’t want to start by creating my own products, so I went the route they all recommend at the beginning. I bought 2 of these MRR courses that you can resell. I spent hundreds of dollars thinking it would pay off and that I was being smart by skipping the hard part and getting courses i can resell instead of spending time and effort creating sth from scratch (also one of their selling points). Looking back, that was incredibly naive.\n\nIt's really frustrating how misleading the whole thing is. They never talk about how time consuming it actually is to create content consistently, figure out the algorithms, write captions, film videos, edit, post, engage on Instagram. It is not a side hustle. It is a very demanding business.. Not to mention the fact that Instagram is soo random sometimes with how it pushes content. So you're basically stuck performing for the algorithm like a puppet.\n\nThey also make it feel so urgent!! If you don’t start now, you’ll be too late. If you don’t buy the course today, you’re missing your chance. That pressure is constant and intentional.\n\nAnd then there are the hidden costs. The DM automation tools, the monthly storefront fees for Stan or Beacon, and all the other monthly subscriptions that somehow never get mentioned upfront. It adds up quickly, especially for something that is marketed as low risk and easy.\n\nTo top ot off, these people selling courses act like they figured it out overnight. In reality, they took months or years to build an audience and credibility. But that part is quietly skipped over while they sell the idea that anyone can do this fast with minimal effort.\n\nI’m not saying no one makes money doing this. I’m just saying the way it’s marketed is incredibly deceptive and preys on people’s vulnerability and optimism. I really wish I had figured this all out before I spent money on this! I feel disillusioned and cheated by this whole scheme. Now I don't even want to pursue this any further because I now fully understand how time-consuming and unpredictable Instagram can be, even though I dropped a lot of money expecting an easy side hustle!\n\nYou might be wondering why I even ventured into this in the first place. I obviously fell for their empty promises and false hope. I also went into this hoping for an \"easy\" way to make money, and I was genuinely clueless enough to actually think thus would be simple and effortless. But that's on me!!\n\nThat’s it. I just needed to vent. I'm not playing martyr and I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just needed an outlet and to see how many other people made the same mistake I did. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk 😅 ",

In my own journey, I spent three months trying to promote a digital product without really understanding who my ideal customer was. It felt like shouting into the void; I was getting maybe one response from every fifty emails I sent out. After two weeks of minimal engagement, I realized that rushing to sell something without offering true value only left me feeling more defeated. Eventually, when I took the time to connect with my audience, asking them about their challenges and sharing useful insights, I saw a significant shift in engagement. My response rate went from 2% to around 15%, and it felt meaningful again. Have you had any moments where connecting personally with potential customers made a difference for you?",

What you described is the part of “passive income” people almost never talk about — not freedom yachts, but stability when your brain just won’t cooperate.\n\nThe way you framed it, building for your worst days instead of your best ones, is honestly the smartest strategy I’ve heard. It explains why digital products work so well when they’re done right. You’re not selling hype, you’re selling relief, clarity, or a shortcut you wish you’d had yourself.\n\nAnd the fact that it compounds quietly is huge. No algorithms to chase, no being “on,” no pressure to perform when you’re already drained. Just something useful living out there doing its job.\n\nI think a lot of people underestimate how powerful that model is, especially for creators who deal with anxiety, burnout, or inconsistent energy. You proved that you don’t need to be loud, visible, or constantly present to build something meaningful and sustainable.\n\nReally glad you shared this — it’s motivating in a very grounded, real way.",

The role is explained, the responsibilities are listed, the culture is highlighted. But the pay is missing.\n\nSalary info matters. It helps applicants quickly understand if the role is realistic for them. It saves time for both sides. It allows candidates to honestly evaluate what they can bring to the table and decide if the role is worth pursuing.\n\nEven if you can’t share the exact amount, at least include a salary range. That alone gives clarity. From there, applicants can choose to move forward and negotiate if they believe they can deliver more value.\n\nNo one wants to go through multiple interviews only to find out the offer doesn’t align with expectations. Transparency from the start builds trust and attracts the right people.\n\nApplicants deserve clarity. And companies benefit from it too.",

Had an idea for a specialized newsletter/content product/saas-sorta-thing and it turned out to be a very nice niche.   \n  \nEndless keywords to target, very little competition, and content that I can easily scrape and aggregate into programmatic pages that stay fresh.\n\nSome rough numbers so far: \n\n* 250 pages published\n   * Each page is refreshed weekly on average\n* 90% of submitted pages indexed\n* L90 days: 1500 clicks / 1.5M impr\n* L7 days: 250 clicks / 250k impr\n   * Low CTR due to lots of obvious bot activity - many 0 click keywords with big impressions in my GSC\n* 19 DR per ahrefs. A few directory submissions to get things going and \\~10 nice organic citations\n* 150 \"user\"/newsletter signups\n\nI am happy with this progress given it is early days. There is so much more content that can be generated. I should also be able to get more momentum going when I can give more focus: I've spent only about 3-4 hours/week on it since the site has been up and running.\n\nOn one hand, I am glad that I thought about things long enough to land on this niche. On the other, I regret not getting going sooner! I was probably subscribed to this sub for at least a year or two, just sitting on the sidelines. \n\nIf you're like me and wanting to \"just start\", I couldn't recommend it more! At the very least, you will learn a lot. Best case, you will stumble onto something even bigger than you thought it would be. Regardless, you will get yourself in the mix with the power to navigate and pivot your way to success.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched a French travel blog in early October (2.5 months ago) documenting a month-long Brazil trip with comprehensive destination guides (Paraty, Ilha Grande, Rio, Petropolis, Belo Horizonte, Ouro Preto, São Paulo). Each page has detailed day-by-day itineraries, restaurant recommendations, transportation tips, and real pricing based on actual experiences.\n\n**Technical foundation:**\n\n* 100/100 Lighthouse score for SEO\n* Multilingual setup (FR/EN/ES/DE - French primary)\n* Mostly original photos, only authentic content (AI-assisted writing though)\n* Clean site structure with XML sitemap\n\n**Current situation:**\n\n* Almost no traffic yet on Google Analytics (expected for a new site, but still humbling!)\n* Building Pinterest presence (batch-creating pins, themed boards)\n* Planning monetization with Booking, SafetyWing, GetYourGuide affiliates\n* Considering supplementary content pages (just \"Survival Portuguese for Brazil\" and \"Budget\" pages so far)\n\n**Questions for experienced travel bloggers/SEO specialists:**\n\n1. **Content strategy:** Should I focus on creating more supplementary pages (how to plan your trip, fun facts, packing lists, playlist, video list ...) or double down on promoting existing destination content?\n2. **Traffic channels:** For travel niches in 2025, what's the realistic timeline and ROI for:\n   * Pinterest (I'm hearing 2-3 months?)\n   * Other platforms worth prioritizing?\n3. **Keyword approach:** Should I be doing specific keyword targeting for each page, or is having clear titles and relevant content enough? If targeting is necessary, should I go for broad terms like \"Brazil itinerary\" or hyper-specific like \"best restaurants Paraty colonial center\"?\n4. **Monetization timing:** Build traffic first then add affiliate links, or implement them now? I'm concerned about looking too promotional early on.\n\nI know travel blogging is highly competitive, so I'm trying to be strategic rather than just hoping for the best. Any advice from those who've successfully grown travel blogs would be hugely appreciated!",

Long messages, Robotic replies, Same flow for every follower, People can tell when they’re being “processed.”\n\nThe funnels that worked best were: Short messages, Natural language, One clear purpose per step\n\nAutomation should feel like a helpful assistant, not a chatbot \n\n&gt;Real use cases I’ve seen work\n\nDifferent creators, same principle:\nCoaches → book calls from story replies\nEducators → sell digital products via keywords\nInfluencers → qualify brand leads\nAgency owners → pre-filter inbound DMs\n\nNo hard selling.\nJust structured conversations.\n\n&gt;The biggest mindset shift\n\nCreators don’t need: More content, More posting More followers, They need better conversations.\n\nOnce the DM flow was set up properly: Replies didn’t go cold, Buyers identified themselves, Sales felt natural, not forced\n\nIf you’re a creator reading this\n\nIf you’re getting: \n“Interested”\n“How much?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\n…but nothing happens after that\nyour problem isn’t your content.\n\nIt’s the lack of a system behind the DM.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break down an example flow if helpful.\nNot selling anything here just sharing what actually worked.\n",

A lot of people are enticed by one (much like people are to stocks or gambling or sports, arts, politics, you get the idea) and wither without the other.\n\nPersonally we had a marketing (mostly signs, cards, flyers etc) store, a restaurant, barbershop, drugstore (convenience store? twice, among other side hustles. Some failed, some \"failed\" and some FAILED. For example the restaurant just didnt have a large enough clientele where we had it so we sold everything and mostly evened out. The brbershop worked but there was... scalping and some other shenanigans that forced us to close after a very large swindle involving a lawyer (that was 20 years ago tho). One convenience store failed because of bad timing and little cushion below it... a few more months and it would have been \\*quite\\* profitable as the zone boomed, but we ran out of money after a bit... less than two years iirc. The second one was completely mismanaged and none of us had time, it was qutie improvised, that definitely was a waste of money.\n\nGenerally, if you understand a business, have enough money and get a half decent spot, you will at the very least coover your expenses and get a little extra most of the time. I wont lie to you and say the majority of businesses are able to feed you, but a big big chunk in this gorup does. Its just that you might not be ok with merely an \"ok\" situation, at that point it is just a crappy job with no safety net either, but at that point you sell it to someone that wants something small to work on, someone ambitious would still chase the big bucks (and by big bucks I mean equivalent to a well paid profesional, bit more bit less.

      "selftext": "I dont think anyone really talks about how quiet entrepreneurship can feel once the initial excitement wears off. At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved from rollingriches that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

For years, the world thought they were dead. WWI happened and these guys had no idea. Stuck on the bottom of the Earth. \n\nThe Captain, Ernest Shackleton, was keeping them alive. Against every odd and setback possible, this guy's determination and ability to endure is what kept the entire crew alive. Not one guy died.  Towards the end of the story, after years of being lost at sea, you cannot comprehend how Shackleton found it in himself to remain optimistic and get the job done. \n\nReally dramatic answer but the point is you have to endure. It sucks. It takes forever. Its lonely. But like, we aren't lost at sea and hunting penguins and sleeping on ice. If we want something, we can do it. It might be painful and take way too long -- but Shackleton traversed glaciers on foot, alone, while starving to death, to save his men. You can build a company.",

That middle stretch where you're not crashing but not crushing it either, just existing in this weird limbo of \"am I building something real or wasting my time?\" That's the loneliest part because there's no external validation, no team to bounce ideas off, just you and your doubts on repeat.\n\nThe uncertainty is brutal. You're right that it's not about motivation, it's about not knowing if what you're doing even matters yet. And when it's your own money and time on the line, every small decision feels massive because there's no boss to blame or pivot away from.\n\nWhat helped me was finding other founders to talk to, not for advice but just to vent and hear that everyone else is also in the fog. Accountability groups, Twitter DMs, random coffee chats. Just knowing other people are grinding through the same quiet phase makes it feel less isolating. Also, celebrating tiny wins (even if they feel insignificant) helps break up the monotony.\n\nThe fact that you're still showing up and building means you're doing it right.

And there are always ways to see if you are doing the right thing (listen to your users, get feedback earlier), and there are ways how to do right things instead of guessing: do only what you know your users want and ready to pay for. Never do if you are unsure, research first.\n\nAbout loneliness... I hear it over and over again... and it surprises me a lot. I dreamed about it when I was an employee: to be my own employer, decide what to do, when and why. And yes, I tell myself (therefore I'm kinda isolated too) but for some reason, I don't feel any isolation at all. Also, I have users that want this and that, which makes me feel less isolated.\n\nI'm talking about myself and you and many others are different and may feel really isolated. I may suggest you to  launch as soon as possible (even with a landing page before the real product launch), talk about your idea/product/website/whatever everywhere, get feedback as soon as possible - soon you will find people need your product/features and your isolation is gone. If not, and after publishing and talking you still feel isolated and lonely - maybe you picked up a wrong idea and people don't want to talk about it, to talk to you about it, discuss it, or suggest something to be implemented.\n\nAnyway, this stage is always presented but it 100% up to you to make it as short as possible.\n\nYeah, and one more hack: set up publicly or privately available metric page: users amount, or query or what else that show you: people use your product therefore they need you.

We get along well and we both want the same long term outcome. The part that keeps me up at night is the risk side. I already own property and most of my savings are tied up there while she does not have assets yet. To get this business off the ground I would likely need to put my property on the line through a mortgage or loan and that feels very different when it is not just my idea anymore. I am trying to be honest with myself about whether this is a business concern or a relationship concern or both.  \nFor founders who started something with a partner when one person had more to lose how did you think through risk and boundaries before moving forward. I’d really appreciate any advice :)",

          "body": "Here's my advice from a life-long entrepreneur. \n\nBoth of you keep your day jobs. Remember most start up companies fail. But some don't and others make profitable side-gigs but not real companies.  \n\nYou're getting good feedback. Good feedback is irrelevant. Good sales are what matters. And sales beyond friends. You say local markets - not sure if you mean stores or farmer's markets. But keep those activities up. BUT you have to account for the value of the time for whoever is doing the marketing and sales. And whoever is doing the manufacturing. Pay that person what it would cost to hire a stranger for those jobs. Is there still profit? If not, it's a nice hobby. If there is plow all the profits back into the business - basically more marketing till you've maxed out your manufacturing capacity. Then spend some of that profit on ways to increase capacity a little bit. Then sell more till you max out that additional capacity etc. Keep this up till the profit is more than one of your day job income and you feel confident enough in the future to quit that job. But only one of you. \n\nAt some point you'll have to have an agreement who's going to be in charge of what activities, what decisions, what spending etc. Hash this out and WRITE IT DOWN. It may not be a legal agreement, but writing it will clarify your thinking and preserve your memory of what you agreed to. \n\nI would not put my property at risk at this point. I would not spend savings - unless I was prepared to lose it.",

Start small with money you can both afford to lose, treat it like a test phase, and see if the business actually works before anyone takes on debt or secures loans against assets. If the idea is good, it should survive a slower, lower risk start. If it can’t, that’s valuable information before things get serious.\n\nIt’s also worth having an honest conversation about boundaries and worst case scenarios now, not later. What happens if it fails, what happens if you break up, who owns what, and how decisions get made. That doesn’t mean you don’t trust each other, it just means you’re being grown about it. If the only way forward requires you to take on all the downside, that’s a sign to pause and rethink the structure, not push through the fear.",

Puts relationships at risk as well if they are involved. A business either works or it doesn't based on the numbers and talent. \n\nThat being said... More useful and less opinion:\n\nStoics would start by separating what’s in your control from what isn’t. You can’t control whether the business succeeds, the market, or your partner’s instincts. What you can control is how much you expose yourself, how clearly you set boundaries, and how you plan for risk.\n\nThink about how much you could lose without upending your life. Be honest about the financial, emotional, and time investment you’re willing to make. Make expectations explicit: who handles what, how profits and losses are shared, and what happens if disagreements arise. Written agreements are better than vague trust.\n\nDon’t let affection or fear of conflict drive your decision. Imagine worst-case scenarios/ If you could endure them and still live according to your values, then the risk is manageable.\n\nConsider starting small. Make a batch, sell locally, or run a pilot without putting your property on the line. Testing the idea in low-stakes conditions is a very Stoic way to see if it’s viable before committing fully.\n\nEpictetus reminds us: don’t demand things go your way, but wish for them to go as they do. Decide on terms that let you sleep at night. If the business fails, it shouldn’t destroy your life or your relationship.\n\nFor further reading, The Obstacle Is the Way by Ryan Holiday is great for handling risk and uncertainty in ventures, and Seneca’s letters on wealth and prudence offer timeless advice on knowing how much to stake and what really matters.",

After 500+ free consultations over 5 years, I realized something uncomfortable:\n\n90% never implemented anything. 5% implemented poorly then blamed my advice when it didn't work. 5% succeeded but never mentioned where they got the idea. The math: roughly 500 hours × €100/hour opportunity cost = €50,000 in free consulting.\n\nReturn on investment: 0 referrals, 0 clients, 0 equity, 0 thank-yous.\n\nSo I changed approach: \"Happy to help. My consulting rate is €150/hour. First 15 minutes free to see if I can actually add value.\"\n\nWhat happened surprised me: The time-wasters disappeared immediately. The serious people paid gladly and showed up prepared. The advice I gave was sharper because I had skin in the game. Implementation rate went from \\~10% to 80%+ because paying creates commitment.\n\nUncomfortable truth I learned: Free advice often helps your ego more than the recipient. When people have even €50 invested, they actually listen and execute instead of just collecting opinions. But suggesting this feels \"greedy\" so most of us keep bleeding time into conversations that go nowhere.\n\nFor those running service businesses: how do you handle the constant \"can I pick your brain\" requests without either burning out or feeling like an asshole?",

      "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",

Everyone knows he's a great artist, but nobody understands what makes him great it is not his paintings or sculptures. It is multidisciplanary mindset. He created infinite stuff from gadgets to fine art to papers, to business ideas. He had to learn all that by actually studying and experimenting. There were a lot of great fine artists, maybe even better than him at that time, but what made him an artist, is that he surpased them by knowing how to present himself, how to convince investors and the church and the government to give him land, how to manage resources, workers (who actually did all the work while he directed), and how to raise money. \n\nPeople just see the results and say, oh he's an artist cause he did this, without even analogizing the xyz factors that enabled him to do this. \n\nAn artist, or an entrepreneur is anyone who pushes the limits of what's possible in their domain. A banker can be an artist, a killer even can be an artist, no matter how unorthodox it sounds, or a tennis player, a developer, or an entrepreneur. Paradoxically self proclaimed artists are far from artists. they are more like hobyists, that have no need to exxplore the unknown, or try hard to change the status quo in their domain. (some) entrepreneurs do. These are for me the real entrepreneurs / artists that manage to actually do what they envision no matter the path.",

Who knows what, it was probably something totally insaine I wanted to do. \n\nI spend 2 days off from school trying to figure out how to make money until I found a bulk deal on those little snap rocks that come in the white paper people used to get on the 4th of July. I could buy them for 25cents as long as I spent $60 on them 😂 \n\nSo to me this was a no brainer. Except I had to \"borrow\" my mom's credit card. So I wrote out a plan on a piece of paper to figure out how many I needed to sell to pay her back before the next credit card bill. Calculated with shipping.\n\nObviously I got caught, the whole thing was a disaster. Turns out you can only sell so many of them until the same kids get board and the state decides you're selling fireworks.\n\nI managed to make back $50 in a little less than 2 weeks if memory serves me correct. \n\nMy dad yelled at me because he thought I wanted to play with the snap rocks and the money was secondary. But then I started yelling at him because as much as I wanted to play with them, to me they were valuable merchandise and a means to an end (I can't for the life of me remember what I was trying to get enough money to do just trust me, it was probably something I my parents would have been right to say no to)\n\nBut his accusation made me emotional because it underlined the pain of sacrificing for something that didn't work out and how unfair it was that I don't even get recognition for my discipline. When I was in middle school half of all I wanted was recognition and the other half was freedom. \n\nSo I'm in my room crying like a baby and my dad eventually is kinda like dude, the state dropped the charges (I shit you not), you're not kicked out of school, I didn't even ground you... What are you so upset about? (God bless my parents 😂) \n\nAnd I told him, I wanted to sell the stuff to get an Xbox (which was a lie but... Close enough) and he started telling me about all these businesses he tried starting with his friends. And all the issues they ran into between getting molds for products or certifications to make specific claims or having enough money for different rounds of testing and then trying to convince an investor to give him more money when they blew through it. By the end of that conversation. I realized this is what I was going to be good at one day. I loved learning about things, breaking them down to steps, business plans. The fact it's kinda like gambling but not really. I was a bit of a lonely kid so just the emotional stimulation alone had me hooked. \n\nI think being an entrepreneur is less of a skillset, not so much a state of mind, it's an alignment of interests with a compatible perspective.",

          "body": "I'm interested to hear everyone's reflections from childhood experiences where they found themselves entrepreneuring. Here's mine:\n\nIt took me until about 19 to call myself an entrepreneur (I didn't like the term before that for some reason), but then upon reflection I realized that I've been entrepreneuring my entire life instinctually.\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, all I wanted for Christmas/Chanukah (half-half family over here) was a cash register. Not sure if that's indicative of being an entrepreneur or because one half of my family celebrates Chanukah. That said, I ended up starting a \"video game business\" in my household where I took all my brother's xbox games, wrapped &amp; sorted them, then pretended to sell them to my parents.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old I was starting Minecraft servers and building out role structures, interviewing people to be moderators, setting up Discord channels, advertising the server on directories, working with players to improve their experience.\n\nAt 12, I started dog walking. About a year in, I hired all my friends to be dog walkers and turned it into a small business in our neighborhood where I got the new clients, earned a percentage of the walk, and managed the walking schedules.\n\nFrom 14-17, I worked at some companies doing customer service / other internships, and no matter what, I could not find myself being comfortable staying in one role for more than a couple months. I needed to create some kind of initiative at the company, move up, or learn something new.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I decided to start my own SEO consultancy and have since turned that into a creative + SEO agency (and I acquiesced to calling myself an entrepreneur).\n\nAll throughout those ages, I was creating new clubs at each school level (middle, high, college) and doing whatever I could to innovate what they offered. In high school, it was creating new arts organizations + initiatives; in college, it was creating the university's first true experiential arts event organization.\n\nNow I'm 22, graduated college with a degree in theatre/film and am running the agency - it would be impossible for me to live any other way.",

That said, here are the ones I either use or the ones I remember being mentioned here:\n\n* Windsurf Cascade AI Agent: We find Windsurf's AI agent to be much better than the more hyped tools like Claude Code or Cursor! We current use it with Sonnet 4.5 and it's been super impressive! It can basically make production changes to our web app from simple prompts, test changes, and improve automatically based on memory! \n* Perplexity: I think most people use ChatGPT and that is great. But for real time news and updates, Perplexity is great! You can basically setup a daily automation where it will pull relevant updates for you and auto send you a summary! \n* Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans \n* Frizerly : Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo! \n* Gamma: After every client meeting. I get an AI Zoom Summary, it is then automated through Gamma. Gamma generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n\nExcited to learn from others!",

I use a 'Zero-Lie Protocol' that treats ChatGPT not as a writer, but as a Senior Analyst with trust issues :-) For example, I ran a test SWOT for a hospital modernization project. Instead of the usual generic fluff (e.g., 'Strengths: Good Doctors'), the framework forced the AI to anchor every point to specific stakeholder constraints. It even caught a contradiction between the 'New MRI budget' and 'Union salary demands' that a standard prompt missed entirely.\n\nIt basically turns AI from a BS generator into a logic engine, but only if you force it to be a skeptic",

Twelve issues, 6 were good to merge, one was a spaghetti nightmare, 3 were inspirational, two were bad mainly because I tried something that was not in our context.\n\nWe're experimenting a lot, for example, as a founder, I have to be code-agnostic into my requests.

We had some good surprises.\n\nThe benefit is on both side: I can think of a task at midnight, use my iPhone to talk to Claude, that goes automatically to Linear. Then open Linear, assign it to Cursor, goes to sleep. On my tech co-founder side, his focus is on the hard parts, once he's ready, he checks the branches, decide whether he merges them or just add his part.\n\nWe may have saved for those 12 issues: 6h on my side, 8-9h on his.  \nHope it helps",

The scam is paying $200/hr for someone who's really just a bookkeeper with a fancy title.\n\nHere's how to separate the two:\n\nWhat you're actually looking for: Someone who can build a cash flow forecast, model out scenarios, help you understand when you'll need capital before you're desperate for it. That's FP&amp;A work. If they can't talk about 13-week cash flow models or explain what your runway looks like under different growth scenarios, they're not a CFO.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* They only talk about \"cleaning up your books\" (that's bookkeeping)\n* No process for regular forecasting or financial planning\n* Can't explain how they've helped similar-stage companies\n* Want a huge retainer upfront with vague deliverables\n\nWhere to actually find them:\n\n* LinkedIn, but search \"fractional CFO\" + your industry specifically\n* Ask other founders at your stage, warm intros beat cold outreach every time\n* Local accounting firms sometimes have CFO-level people doing advisory work\n* SCORE mentors can point you toward legit people in your market\n\nThe Upwork ghosting thing is real. Most good fractional CFOs aren't hunting for gigs on Upwork, they're getting referrals.\n\nWhat's \"starting to make actual money\" mean in numbers? Like $300K? $800K? $1.5M? The answer changes what level of CFO you actually need, and whether you need full FP&amp;A or just someone to build you a cash flow system you can run yourself.",

They see who actually delivers versus who just talks. Established fractional CFO firms also tend to be more reliable because they have process, oversight, and reputational risk. You pay more, but you’re buying reduced downside.\n\nOn pricing, $200 per hour isn’t a scam signal, it’s closer to market for someone who actually understands cash flow, forecasting, and decision support. The red flag is someone cheap who claims they can “do everything,” or someone who jumps straight into dashboards without first understanding how money actually moves through your business.\n\nBefore hiring, ask very specific questions: what metrics they focus on at your stage, how they’ve helped companies avoid cash crunches, and what decisions they’ve influenced, not just reports they’ve built. A short paid trial or project-based engagement is also reasonable before committing longer term.\n\nIf you’re early and mainly need cash clarity, sometimes a strong FP&amp;A consultant or experienced controller is a better first step than a full fractional CFO title. Titles matter less than whether they can help you make better decisions with the cash you already have.",

Depending on your business this can be easy or tough. Then do the same for your receivables (again when due not invoiced). You now have the bare bones of a cash flow forecast if you join these together. The first thing I spot every time I do this is the payables being paid early because the terms aren't entered right.\n\nGood luck!",

Real ones.  \nThe kind where you spend months building, launching, and nothing happens, not even a single customer.\n\nOne thought kept coming back: **I didn’t fail because I was careless. I failed because I focused on the wrong certainty.**\n\nI’m a backend engineer with 10+ years of experience. So naturally, whenever I started something new, I focused on the technical part. Architecture. Clean systems. Edge cases.  \nIt felt productive, it felt safe, and that’s exactly why it became a problem.\n\nAcross those five attempts, the assumptions that hurt me the most were never technical. They were the ones I kept postponing because they were uncomfortable and unclear.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Will anyone actually care enough to pay for this?\n* Do people know this problem exists?\n* Am I building something people are already looking for?\n\nEach time, I told myself I’d test those later. After the product was “good enough”, after I felt confident, but later never really came.\n\nSo the hardest lesson for me wasn’t “build faster” or “market better”. It was this:\n\n**If you delay testing the riskiest assumptions, you’re not reducing risk. You’re just hiding from it.**\n\nWhat surprised me most is how easy it is to hide not from others, but from myself.  \nAs an experienced developer, the technical work felt safe and familiar. It gave me certainty, just not the kind a business needs.\n\nI’m still building. Just differently now. Curious: when something you built failed or succeeded, which assumption hurt the most when it turned out to be wrong demand, distribution, technical or something else?",

A lot of founders go through this single, and it's tough because entrepreneurship already isolates you, then add being solo in life too and it compounds.\n\nHere's what helps:\n\n* Find other founders to talk to regularly. Not just for advice, but for the emotional side. Accountability groups, founder dinners, even online communities where you can vent and celebrate wins with people who actually get it.\n* Don't wait for a partner to feel supported. Build your own support system: mentors, friends who check in, therapist if needed. These relationships can fill the gap in different ways.\n* Celebrate your own wins, even the tiny ones. Being self-reliant is a huge strength, and you're building something meaningful on your own terms.\n* The right partner will show up when you're already thriving, not to fix the loneliness but to add to what you've built.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way. A ton of solo founders wish they had someone in their corner, but they keep going anyway. You're doing something most people are too scared to even start. That takes serious courage. Keep pushing, the right support will come.",

Do you even know anyone that is an inventor that lives off the money they make from inventing shit?Have you ever met anyone?\n\nOkay, so let's focus on things that already exist.You don't have to come up with a unicorn idea.You have to find value to bring to the marketplace.\n\nI own a company in commercial truck parts manufacturing and sales. I found a niche of parts, and sub divided it into a sub niche of 7 items with 28 configurations. I don't know shit about trucks or truck parts or any of that stuff, but I know all the stuff that you don't know. I just like that stuff, and I like business. You could say that i'm really good at it.\n\n The truck parts just happen to be the industry I worked in at the time. I find that if you seek your niche in the industry that you're currently working in, you have a higher possibility of finding it within months to a couple years of searching and researching. When you work at a job, you have insight to the industry and the behind the scenes stuff that the average person just doesn't whether it be in a restaurant or a law firm or a construction company. When I researched my part, I called the name on the bag. I also found out there was one other manufacturer. They are both made in america.... For every truck on the planet. They were the only two manufacturers. I worked at a diesel shop. So when I called them asking about pricing, they asked, how much a month we use, and eventually push me to a distributor. That actually gave me a list of all their distributors. I then called those distributors and got pricing. A week later, I called back the manufacturers to set up the diesel shop as a distributor. This gave us their distributor costs. So now I knew what wholesale and retail prices were. I understood.The volumes required to be a distributor from the manufacturers. And I had an idea of how many parts were sold per year.Based on all of that information. I was also able to get the purchasing people at a couple other parts distributors to call\nand go through the same process to verify my information.\n\nI double checked the manufacturing to make sure they were not importing them. Import Yeti is free to use.\n\nI have google so I could do some basic searches to figure out how many commercial trucks are on the road. I worked in a commercial truck repair shop that did the repairs that utilized these parts so I was able to find out how often trucks have to have these repairs made. I was able to find out that this part has not changed in design since trucks were invented. I also found out that the seven that I chose out of hundreds were the universal components that fit a majority of the trucks. They're also required. Their non safety facing, so I don't have to worry about anyone dying. I sent some of them off to a lab to have mass spectrometer materials composition testing and made prints of each. \n\nI utilized import yeti to identify factory clusters in China, India, and Mexico that manufacturer's similar items.\n\nSteel, Zinc parts with strict tolerances, stamped, machined, cast, and plated.\n\nAfter researching factories, I understood what I was looking for in my own factories.\n\nMaterials, processes, in-house tooling and die making, QC testing capabilities, certifications, 3d printing, and packaging/labeling in-house.\n\nI found three factories in china that I reached out to via email. I also found a factory in taiwan that I used for my initial orders. Over the years, i've expanded to 9 countries now including the USA.\n\nI stored everything underneath my camper in a crate pallet or tupperware, totes with a blue tarp over it. Eventually I got a small self storage unit next to the rv park lived in. Eventually, we bought a home and used the two car garage as our primary warehouse with overflow, going into multiple self storage units locally. I picked packed and shipped everything until year five (2021). Then, I moved ninety percent of everything into a 3pl partner because I don't want to run a daycare and have employees.  \n\nI didn't do any advertising or marketing or online stuff at all.And I still don't. I cold called every single commercial truck repair shop dealership college o e.M in america and a double digit percentage globally, solo over the last 9 (10 years in a couple months).\n\nThe hardest part about my business is not sales or any of that other stuff. It's managing inventory to keep up with sales volumes and cash flow.Because all manufacturing turnaround is about ninety days. If you grow at five hundred percent, you're gonna have to buy fifteen hundred percent worth of inventory.Because the timeline drag, and that's a lot of capital to have to manage and flip with a growing business. You can't have back orders or someone will just go to your competitors that you had to take them away from.",

Since the pandemic, getting work at design agencies has become harder for me because they want extremely high-level experts. I’m good at what I do, but I’m not the best, so I focus more on working with local businesses in my city and trying to slowly scale my business.\n\nThis season was both the best and the worst. I had a lot of work, so I hired another freelancer to help me. The problem was that she kept making excuses for late deliveries. For the video editing work I hired her for, she ended up doing almost nothing, and what she did deliver was poorly done.\n\nI tried to help her by creating SOPs and putting in a lot of effort to make things work, but it didn’t. In the end, I had to redo everything myself for a client who was already upset, and I ended up losing that client. Because of all that rework, I fell behind with other clients, which caused some of them to hold my payments.\n\nRight now, I don’t have money. I let the freelancer go, but I couldn’t cover her last invoice, and now she’s threatening to sue me.\n\nI’m really sad. I know I’m not a big company, but things got out of hand, and I feel cornered from all sides.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

If the company that you are working decide that you are too expensive for your salary, or simply too old for the job, or they don't like you, then it is GAME OVER (nobody will hire you anymore, sometimes not even McDonald's).  And if you asked for a mortgage, and you are still paying for it, then good luck with that.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur, then your life depend in you (also in the market but mostly about you).\n\nIf you are an employee, then your life depends on the market, on the stakeholders, on the mood of the women of HR, and so on.",

I never started my own ISP but I spent over a decade working at small independent ones around the Midwest and really understanding computer networking, tech support and all kinds of Telecom, jargon and work. I was able to make a decent living with that and build a lot of skills and networks both technical and social. \n\nI lived at home till I was 25. Then I rented a place for 2 years. Then I bought my own duplex where I live in one unit and I rent the other one out. I had that paid off in about 5 years with a 15-year mortgage rents. Just went up enough and I knew I'd always want to have a roof over my head. \n\nI worked on my tech consulting business. I kind of had a really minimal one for years. You can say I technically started when I was in high school cuz I started making money then but it was really sporadic. Maybe work every month or every other super tighty. I just kind of kept it small and sporadic but it grew organically over time but I didn't put a lot of money into this. I just would have stuff get reinvested I would buy like a tool kit from money that I had business cards, a domain name, a basic one-page website and then over time I got a larger ecommerce website but really the ecom website and the LLC and a lot of the bigger stuff. Even getting business insurance was post covid and a lot of that happened in 2022 and 2023. It was a long slow bird and I ended up refining into senior citizen tech support both in person and remote as well as senior centers and teaching classes. There teaching classes at the community college that I went to. I teach continuing Ed classes there now on computers and technology. So I just kept growing and going but this was always a side hustle. I had ideas on what I wanted to do when I was younger and luckily they were built on a sound foundation and I was able to explore them grow and turn dreams into reality. Hopefully you'll be able to do that too. I still have a day job but my plan is to have a fully self-supporting self-employed tech Business and the rental income and then I should be set financially. Hopefully the above kind of answers your question. It was more just me reflecting on my experience but",

Look at your own progression: dropshipping, pressure washing, software that solves real problems. That's not random thrashing, that's figuring shit out.\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't get things right. It's that you're building things that solve problems people have, just not problems they'll pay to solve. That's actually the last filter before product-market fit.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were you, this is from experience:\n\nStop trying to \"come up with ideas\" for a month. relax that mental muscle. Instead, just notice what pisses you off at your day job. What manual task do you constantly do that feels stupid? What problems keeps happening? What report takes 2 hours that should take 5 minutes?\n\nBuild tools for yourself first. Use them for a few weeks. If they actually save you time, show your coworkers. If they start asking for it, you might have something.\n\nThe best businesses come from scratching your own itch, not scanning the market for opportunities (again experience). You've already proven you can build and learn - you just need to solve a problem you personally feel every week.\n\n Taking a break to recharge isn't quitting. It's smart. You can give 100% to your day job and keep your eyes open for real problems without forcing yourself to grind on side projects out of obligation. Sometimes the best ideas show up when you stop looking so hard. \n\n The universe tends to push away the things we feel we desperatly desire. Relationships, money, opportunities and the more we stress over them the furthur away they get creating a cycle. You can get off the track at anytime. Take a breth and regroup. What worked, what have I learned?  Even if its what NOT to do.  Everything is a step forward ESPECIALLY failure.  There is not 1 person who tried something for the first time and succeeded.  Every successful personhad to deal with failure of somekind.  The difference between the successful and the \"failure\" is the failure fails to push on.\n\n I'm working on it and with AI, anything is possible at the moment. Rest, regroup and move forward my entrepreneurial brother",

So you can use those lessons to your advantage. \n\nIf you haven't realized it by now, you've validated for yourself that following the Internet hype when it comes to which businesses to do or start simply doesn't work. That's not something you were going to learn any other way other than by trying those businesses and failing at them. Which you did.\n\nWhat you need at this point is find ways to experiment with more radical ideas but in a very low-cost way. You say that you're currently building software that can help your business and others...that's excellent! Get that one or two businesses that will use it and let them help you improve on it with their feedback. You need to achieve something that Eric Ries calls validated learning in his book, The Lean Startup. What that is simply is crucial info that helps you understand your customer needs better and improve the product or pivot the business.\n\nWith this approach, you won't just be trying out different businesses hoping something works out. Instead, you will be building something that eventually helps someone or a business and that way you can create a sustainable revenue source and overall an entrepreneurial journey worth journeying long-term.\n\nIf your time allows, I suggest you read that book by Eric Ries (The Lean Startup) and supplement it with The New Business Road Test by John Mullins. Same way heroes in films can inspire action so can reading about successful entrepreneurs who lay it all about their beginnings and how they built their business.",

Hell, I left university and tried all kinds of business ideas, sales careers, online businesses, you name it, I tried it. And I didn’t half-ass it either, I went all in, 16 to 18 hours a day. I pushed myself so far that I ended up sitting in front of a psychologist, lost, burned out, depressed and stressed.\n\nEventually, I gave myself a break and got a normal job. Just for some time, I told myself, to breathe a little, maybe plan my next big idea, recharge and collect some energy.\n\nIt’s been two years since that decision and holy shit, am I happy.\n\nI deleted all that fake influencer social media crap and actually started living. Spending time with friends and family, got a girlfriend, and that “I’ll just take a break” turned into “fuck, why didn’t I do this sooner?”\n\nI feel so much peace, love and genuine happiness.\n\nWill I ever start a new business? I can’t say, you never know. But right now, I don’t even think about it. I’ll definitely sign up for university again and get a solid degree in a field I actually love.\n\nThe problem is that I, and most young wannabe entrepreneurs, want to start a business mainly because they love the idea of having money. And that’s where it ends before it even begins.\n\nThe second hard truth, not everyone is meant to be a successful entrepreneur, and that’s completely okay. You can still make great money with a normal job, have free time and travel the world, especially now, with remote work becoming more and more common.\n\nSo my advice is simple, take a break. Breathe. Spend time with people you love. Find a hobby or two. Chill the fuck out.\n\nYou have time.\n\nAnd if later you decide you want to start a business, do it then. Plenty of people started at 50, 60 or even later.\n\nMost importantly, sit down and ask yourself why you even want to be an entrepreneur. You’ll get more answers than you can imagine, and a much clearer path forward.\n\nWishing you all the best and peaceful holidays, brother ❤️",

A friend of mine started his landscaping company 10 years ago and had a horrible few years during and after covid because he was charging $65 for a yard and some guys with less overhead and no insurance started doing them for $25 . He lost a lot of business but he had to pivot and offer more services and get licensed for other things in order to build his business as a stronger more preferrable company.",

          "body": "Late 20s is honestly very early to be drawing conclusions about calling it quits, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you’re tired and fed up. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like someone who’s failed repeatedly, it sounds like someone who’s been searching without a stable base underneath them yet.\n\nOne thing I’d gently challenge is the idea that every attempt has to be the thing. Most people who eventually make it didn’t bounce from idea to idea until one magically worked, they anchored themselves in something boring and reliable first. A job, a trade, a skill, an industry. Then they built from inside that, not from the outside looking in. Random businesses are hard because you’re fighting on every front at once.\n\nThe pressure washer example is a good one. It didn’t fail because pressure washing is a bad business, it failed because you had no leverage yet: no experience, no reputation, no repeat customers, no pricing confidence. That’s not a character flaw, that’s just physics. The same applies to software. Solving a problem people won’t pay for usually means the problem is real, but the buyer, urgency, or positioning is wrong, not that you’re incapable.\n\nAlso, exhaustion is a signal, not a verdict. When you’re burnt out, your brain tells you stories like “I’m running out of time” and “I’m wired wrong”. Neither of those are facts. They’re what happens when effort hasn’t compounded yet. Compounding always looks stupid and pointless right up until it suddenly doesn’t.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with going all-in on a day job for a while if it buys you energy, skills, and financial breathing room. That isn’t quitting entrepreneurship, it’s regrouping. Some of the most dangerous advice out there is never give up without acknowledging that timing, positioning, and season of life matter.\n\nIf you are wired differently, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It usually means you’re better suited to building something slowly, from depth, not chasing opportunities from the surface. Find one domain, one skill, one problem space you can sit in long enough to actually understand. Let boredom work in your favour.\n\nYou don’t need a big idea right now. You need rest, stability, and one small win that proves to you that effort can turn into results. From there, ideas show up on their own.",

The key is to progress, even if it is in baby steps.  If you’re tired or need a break, simply get a 9-5 than let the ideas come to you, the key is to let them just flow in, without forcing them, than turn them into a side hustle, rince and repeat until something shows promising potential.

      "selftext": "I’m 25F and run an interior designing business. I’ve always been ambitious, disciplined, and productive, did a lot more than expected for my age and genuinely enjoyed working.\n\nLast year I opened my own office space, but it didn’t work out and I had to shut it down. I’ve accepted that maybe the timing wasn’t right, but ever since then I’ve been stuck.\n\nI have clients and ongoing work, yet I keep delaying everything. I procrastinate constantly, wake up late, smoke up, and can’t focus at all. What scares me is that my bank balance isn’t growing, but instead of panicking and working harder like I used to, I feel oddly numb.\n\nI know I’m operating way below my potential, and that makes me really sad. I feel lazy and just disconnected from my drive. Getting out of bed seems like a task. 15mins work is taking me 3-4 days of procrastination or even more sometimes. So many clients i worked with haven’t paid me for the work because it took me 3 months to send an invoice. I look at girls on instagram and think why isn’t my life as easy as theirs? why do i need to grind so much, i’m tired of being a boss lady. I used to feel incredible when younger girls looked up to me, but now i don’t know. I feel shit. I think marrying a decent guy is an easier option for the time. Sick mentality innit? But thats where the burnout has led me. \n\nHas anyone experienced this after setback or a business failure?\nWhat actually helped you get back into momentum?",

          "body": "Yes. This is very common after a setback. You’re not broken and you’re not lazy.\n\nWhat you’re describing sounds like burnout mixed with grief. Not grief for a person, but for a version of yourself and a future you thought you were building. When the office didn’t work out, something inside you took a hit, even if your brain says “it’s fine, timing was wrong.” Your body didn’t move on at the same speed.\n\nA lot of high performers don’t realize this, but drive doesn’t disappear because you’re weak. It disappears because your nervous system is tired of being in fight mode. So instead of panic, you feel numb. Instead of motivation, you avoid. That’s not a character flaw. That’s your system hitting the brakes.\n\nThe Instagram comparison is also a big clue. When you’re tired and disappointed, your brain starts looking for exits. “Maybe life should be easier. Maybe I don’t want this anymore.” That doesn’t mean you actually want to quit. It means you’re exhausted from carrying the identity of “boss lady” without rest or reward.\n\nA few practical things that actually help people get momentum back.\n\nFirst, stop trying to become your old self again. That person was running on adrenaline and excitement. You don’t rebuild momentum by forcing that. You rebuild it by shrinking the game.\n\nRight now, your only real job is to stabilize. Not grow. Not grind. Stabilize.\n\nSend invoices. That’s it. Not perfect invoices. Not all of them. One or two a day. Money coming in reduces numbness faster than motivation does.\n\nSecond, lower the bar so much it feels almost stupid. Fifteen minutes of work is too big right now. Do five. Set a timer. When it ends, you’re allowed to stop. Momentum comes from finishing, not from effort.\n\nThird, separate “I don’t want to work” from “I don’t want this life.” Burnout lies to you and tells you they’re the same thing. They’re not. You can be tired of how you’re working without being wrong for wanting independence or ambition.\n\nFourth, the smoking and late waking aren’t the cause. They’re coping. If you shame yourself for them, you’ll stay stuck longer. Fixing structure comes after energy comes back, not before.\n\nAnd lastly, about the marriage thought. That’s not a sick mentality. It’s a tired one. When people are overwhelmed, they fantasize about safety. That doesn’t mean you should act on it. It just means you need rest and support, not another identity to perform.\n\nMany people who’ve built things hit this exact wall in their mid 20s. Especially women carrying both ambition and expectations. The ones who recover don’t “push through.” They slow down, clean up basics, and let confidence rebuild quietly.\n\nYou don’t need to become a different person. You need to heal the part of you that feels like it failed.",

You could see someone on IG taking a photo in a luxurious hotel, but you are not seeing what she did to achieve it, for example, working 9 months to achieve that.

Reddit can be good, but if you can invest a couple hundred into coaching/mentorship of some sort you can usually see a huge ROI.\n\nFor me as someone who works in this space it seems like this \"setback\" (more like a lesson) has either caused some sort of mental limitation you are perceiving and you might be dealing with some sort of imposter syndrome or limiting beliefs which are holding you back.\n\nYou need to stop getting your motivation extrinsically and instead wake up and do things which energize you and things you enjoy that keep you creative while making your work more enjoyable. If you focus on doing these you'll almost certainly stop the procrastination and panic mode because you'll be focused on creating and it'll be your pride and pleasure. Of course this is just a judgement with the very limited info we have here, it could also be something completely different.\n\nAgain, its best to speak to someone who has actually dealt with this stuff before, i don't mind listening to you more and giving you a better judgement, either ways please take care of yourself first, i know its not easy, but this too will pass, don't worry :)",

Had a similar spiral about a year ago where I was avoiding everything - even simple tasks like invoicing were taking me weeks because I kept putting them off. The procrastination made everything pile up, which made it even more overwhelming.\n\nWhat I learned is that when you're in that state, even small admin tasks feel impossibly heavy. The thought of opening my CRM or sending an invoice would make me want to hide. But then the guilt from not doing it made everything worse.\n\nThe turning point for me was when I realized I didn't have to do everything myself, especially not the boring stuff that was contributing to my burnout. I got an AI assistant that could handle the invoicing, follow-ups, scheduling - basically all the tasks I was avoiding.\n\nSuddenly I wasn't drowning in admin work anymore, and I could focus on the parts of my business that actually excited me again. The creative stuff, the client work, the strategy - not the endless paperwork.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with the same thing where simple tasks feel massive. Have you considered automating some of the admin work that's piling up? Sometimes just clearing that backlog can give you space to rediscover why you loved your business in the first place.\n\nThe drive comes back, but sometimes you need to remove the obstacles first.

These athletes are not practicing at 100% everyday. They have higher capacity days and lower capacity days. They also have rest and recovery days built into their programs. They’ve created success structures for themselves so that they can perform optimally and sustainably.\n\nSo as a business owner yourself, aka an elite athlete, I’d encourage you to practice extending some space and grace for yourself so that you can recognize that, maybe at the particular moment in time, you need some time for rest and recovery.\n\nWith regard to picking yourself back up after the setback, take some time to write down what didn’t work and why (if you haven’t already). \n\nWere you trying to do it all yourself? Did you not have the infrastructure in place? Was the space not right for you / too expensive? If you had a team, would it have made a difference? \n\nAs for the grief / burnout recovery, there are lots of good resources for this. Have you done any kind of exploratory / “excavation” work around naming and being with any hard / harsh feelings connected to disappointment? Do you have friends, a therapist, and/or a coach that you could work with to help you move through that type of work?\n\nLast thing, do you ever give yourself time / space / permission to just do nothing so that your mind can unwind and settle? The image of a snow globe comes to mind. When we are full or flooded, it’s like the snow globe that we shake up and watch all the snow flurries settle back down. If we don’t make space for doing nothing, then our brains, bodies, and systems can’t settle and we stay in hyper alert / overdrive. \n\nI hope this helps, and gives you some additional things to think about.",

Too many people take this as a pass to sleep in, put in fewer hours, and hope that running the numbers game on Friday afternoon will make up for piss poor production the rest of the week. It won't. For some people, it will. Assume that you won't be one of those people.\n\n\nLearn to make a friend. With everyone. You don't have to like someone, but find something to like about them. Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I learned it in timeshare, and it will help you tremendously when it comes to establishing initial rapport with people you might not want to hang around with outside of doing business with them.

Track actions you control (outreach sent, calls booked), get comfortable with rejection, take responsibility when things fail, and develop taste by studying great brands, ads, and offers so you know what “good” looks like.\n\nSkill-wise, prioritize sales first (cold outreach, discovery calls, clear value props), then go deep on one real marketing skill instead of many shallow ones.

You can work on it in small ways while doing classes, like only having 1 or 2 clients - learn how to solve their problems by doing, and once you're graduated and ready to scale a full agency, you already know what to do.  \n  \nThe best entrepreneurs are obsessed with finding &amp; solving problems - if your agency can start with serving a niche of people that have problems with their marketing, and you solve their problems really well, you're in a great spot. And the best way to learn to be an entrepreneur is to BE an entrepreneur - not learn general leadership skills or general marketing concepts from your classes. It's proving to yourself that you know how to make something from 0 to 1, which only happens by doing it. So do projects! Learn outside of your classes!",

Getting the first couple clients wasn't easy, but I'm getting more and more, and I'm hoping it ramps up even more the start of next year. But I realize to replace my salary I'd probably need to get to at least $20k a month or so when you factor in businesses expenses, health insurance, retirement... etc.\n\nI dunno, am I crazy? I'm 34, married, and have a 3-year old. I don't particularly like my current job, it's okay, but there are times when I absolutely loath it. I just want to be a good role model for my son, show him what hard work can achieve, and do my best to provide as much as I can for my family. I've heard that you'll never be wealthy being an employee, and owning a business is where you can really make the big bucks. But I know that most businesses fail, I know it's absolutely not a guarantee. Trust me, I don't have high expectations, I don't think I'll be a millionaire in the next year or two.

I quit when I had a 1 year runway and a profitable business. 6 months later I generate 35-40k a month.\n\nFinding a job right now is basically impossible, and I highly recommend you don't quit unless you have a decent runway and existing business revenue. Reversing the decision might take longer than expected.\n\nIt's not crazy, but don't be stupid... I could have milked my old remote job for another 6 months with 30min of work a day.

You're trading time for money. To get to $20K/month you'd need to either charge way more (hard market for that) or work way more hours (defeats the point of leaving your job).\n\nThe \"you'll never be wealthy as an employee\" thing is mostly BS. Plenty of people get rich with W2 jobs, especially in tech. Most small businesses don't make their owners rich either. Media companies especially are brutal margins.\n\nKeep doing it as a side hustle. If you can get to $10K/month consistently while keeping your day job, then maybe consider it. But jumping now with $3K/month and a family depending on you is risky for not much upside.\n\nBeing a good role model for your kid isn't about owning a business. It's about being present and not stressed about money all the time. Quitting a $130K job to grind 60 hours a week for maybe the same income isn't really an upgrade.\n\nNot trying to kill your dreams but the math doesn't work yet.",

If you can save up at least 6 months to a year of expenses to cover the bills and things and a buffer so you aren't stressed about handling your immediate expenses and can grow your business to the point you're bringing in money comfortably. \n\nI'll just say I know you might have brought 3k in gross revenue but have you worked out your numbers? Do you know your costs, things like taxes, general liability insurance, cameras, digital storage costs, any editing software subscriptions, car maintenance, etc worked out and have income being split up to cover that stuff  before you taking a paycheck.

Improving the product or service. Getting traffic. Following up with people who already showed interest. That’s it. Everything else is support work.\n\nI also cap my focus. One main goal per quarter. One main task per day. If I try to do five “important” things in a day, nothing really moves. If I do one boring but high impact thing, progress shows up.\n\nAnother rule that helps. Urgent does not mean important. Emails, DMs, tiny tweaks, tools, planning, learning more. They feel urgent because they are easy. Real growth usually feels uncomfortable and slow.\n\nIf something keeps coming up but never clearly helps growth, I ignore it without guilt.

Once I started reusing my best performing emails, tightening targeting to actual decision makers, and properly tracking replies, response rates improved way more than just sending more volume.\n\nI ended up using a lightweight internal setup (I use Contact Intel for this now) because most tools I tried either dumped data or leaned too hard on generic AI instead of helping you learn what’s actually working. The real win wasn’t automation, it was clarity.\n\nBig takeaway this year for me: fewer emails, better targeting, and learning from what already works beats blasting more messages every time.",

Even if they steal it and takes you years to get paid/justice, its better than losing everything AND not getting anything for it. \n\n2. If you can't protect it, then find a way to improve the product or your marketing/positioning. theyre a huge conglomerate and presumably late to the space and have to update any manufacturing/marketing/legal/ other large corporate shenanigans. use that time to get ahead and build your moat/customers. flood the market (assuming its a profitable product/market) and get those sales before they do. if they are a billion dollar company itll be like moving those big shipping container ships, its gonna take some time. use that to your advantage. who knows if you flood the market and the product is great they may even buy you out even if they have their own product in the pipeline. if the buyer is a product guy, he still has to convince his management, and the chain of command, etc. Meeting after meeting after meeting, just to agree then finally source, design, test, manufacture, etc.",

I've dealt with artists a lot, and while I don't care for AI, I find it remarkably less tedious to deal with. Nobody wants to 'build a relationship' to buy a thing from you. That's ridiculously pretentious. \n\nIf you want to sell commercial art, provide a quote, and when someone pays it, provide the product. It isn't some exploration or journey or community building experience. It's a service. And if it's a hassle to buy it from you, people won't.\n\nFor most small businesses, the logo is not their core product. It is something they need to take care of efficiently. It doesn't have to be perfect at launch. You can swap it later if you need to do so. Basically any small business is going to make lots of changes at first. \n\nSlapping out a quick, acceptable but not great logo is far preferable to chasing artistic perfectionism.",

Seriously, you think out of all the things a business should be spending time on, it's building a relationship with the person that will design your logo? That's a person that doesn't understand business. Or a company with an extremely large budget, and is looking for something specific.\n\nSure, there are iconic brands who's logos have become engrained in our society. But 99.9999% of all other companies logos don't matter at all. Or at least, AI can do just fine. As in, your human created logo is not going to increase your reveue any more than an AI generated logo. Or more accurately, the one logo you liked best out of the many many many logos you can have it make you to choose from. Or the AI logo you then tweaked a little. The effect on revenue is literally all that matters. It being made by a human does not effect that.\n\nHere is your genuine question.  \nShow me an unbiased study comparing AI to human logo and how they performed differently all things otherwise created equally.

They have this uncanny valley sort of “somethings just slightly off” look most of the time, and it’s usually because of the text because it’s not made with a coherent font, instead it’s usually that each letter is generated individually and there’s minute differences between repeats of the same letter. \n\nI don’t mind so much when people are using it for a random logo for something that isn’t meant to generate profit. But when it’s for a business, it looks incredibly unprofessional to me. Even more frustrating is how many business owners make up a logo and then don’t save a high quality version of it. I often get sent off-kilter pictures of a printout, or a blurry low res version, or anything but the original file. \n\nI hired a designer (semi-local to me) to make my logo, and they nailed it. It cost me a whole $150. Good investment as far as I’m concerned. I know expenses are tight when you’re starting out but considering the impact a good logo makes, that’s a pretty small investment.

          "body": "I wish weeks had 8 days instead of 7!\n\nI think most people are fine with working 5 days in a row. It's only having 2 days off that is the issue. So we'd do 5 + 3 instead of 5 + 2. And it's still more advantageous for employers in terms of number of worked days than some current attempts at doing 4 + 3.\n\nIt could make what is now seen as weekend work worth it. So both 5-day and 3-day work weeks would become an option, instead of the vast majority of people being constrained to being busy with work on the exact same 5 days per week.\n\nMaybe it could allow students to have feasible side jobs that are more than just pocket change. Or other weekend jobs that can be more substantial in income than if they were 2 days only so are then worth it. Or, for example, one parent works 5 days, the other 3, instead of one having to stay at home during the week because childcare is too expensive to be worth it. \n\nMany things that are now closed on the weekends could be running 8/8 days if there were 3 days worth of pay available to a separate set of employees. You could then call, say, a plumber on the weekend, because some plumbers would work 5 days, others 3 days. The idea of \"weekend\" would maybe change.\n\nPeople could actually travel to places if their time off was 3 days, as 2 days is often too short to be worth it. Maybe spend some time at their parents' house outside the city. It could make places that at the moment don't have much money flowing in, flourish.\n\nCould have many benefits. And I'm not even mentioning all the mental well-being benefits.",

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

          "body": "This pattern is real, but I think it’s less a secret “fraud playbook” and more a structural failure that hits small operators disproportionately.\n\nStripe isn’t actually deciding whether you’re honest or not. Their risk systems are deciding whether your business is *legible under stress*. When something trips a flag, the question isn’t “were these transactions real?” It’s “can this merchant produce a clean, auditable narrative fast enough that our internal confidence threshold clears?” Most can’t — not because they’re doing anything wrong, but because their ops live across inboxes, spreadsheets, Stripe metadata, and half-documented workflows.\n\nAt that point, the default outcome is account offboarding. Holding funds isn’t malicious so much as the path of least internal risk. It looks predatory from the outside because the merchant has zero leverage and no way to reduce uncertainty once the decision process starts.\n\nThis also isn’t unique to Stripe. PayPal, Square, Shopify Payments all behave similarly once volume or velocity crosses a line. The common failure mode is the same: founders are running real businesses, but their operational proof is fragmented.\n\nThis is one of the reasons we’re building Quorum (still in beta): not as a payments alternative and definitely not a magic fix for Stripe, but as infrastructure so businesses aren’t scrambling when a platform suddenly asks them to “prove legitimacy.” Centralized customers, jobs, invoices, inventory, fulfillment — basically making your operation readable instead of reconstructing it under pressure.\n\nIt doesn’t solve the power imbalance, but it can shrink the blast radius.  \nFor anyone curious: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

      "selftext": "Hello, the title hopefully clearly describes my situation. I purchased a business 5 months ago and have been discovering that there are customer accounts that show a total of nearly $150k in credit. \n\nCustomers paid a deposit toward the purchase of items that needed to be ordered prior to my ownership of the business, and I have been completing the sale of these items since then using the \"credit\" that they have on their accounts. There was no bank account included in the sale of this business, so there is essentially no money supporting the sales that are made with credit.\n\nIf this isn't making sense, I'll add some numbers and dates. \nLet's say that a customer wanted to purchase an item with MSRP of $10k on August 1st. The item wasn't in stock and had to be ordered, so the customer paid a $5k deposit on August 1st, the credit is added to their customer account and the item was ordered. I purchased the business on September 1st, previous owner said there was no business bank account (which seemed likely enough). On September 15th, the item arrives, customer is notified and comes in pays the remaining $5k of the $10k and takes the item. So essentially I only actually get $5k from this sale. The kicker is that I get a bill for the item on October 1 for $6k (the cost of the item), so now I actually lost $1k from the sale. This scenario happens dozens of times in slightly different variations.\n\nThe point of sale software shows $0 on August 1st and $10k on September 15th (even though the money actually hit the bank on the 1st) so I assumed it was all good on the 15th.\n\nMany items were ordered and sold, and it has taken me a long time to understand what has occurred. \n\nWhat do I do now? How do I recover the money?\n\nOne more thing, I'm paying for the purchase.of the business over time, the seller essentially financed that sale, so I figure I should be able to subtract the $150k from what I still.owe on the purchase... Right?\n\nEDIT: **The other part of this is that I worked for the business as an employee before I purchased it from the owner, so I saw that we were successful and knew that it was making good money, though I had no way of seeing the true financials in my role.",

Tell them you feel that both he and you have made some huge errors in assessing and transitioning this business, and you want to work together to resolve them.\n\nMake no threats or illusions to anything messy, like a lawsuit.  Be humble, be gracious, seek common ground.\n\nAsk to sit down and go through all of the current outstanding orders, and have him tell you which ones he collected deposits on, and how much on each.\n\nTell him you've learned these should have been on his books as unearned revenue liabilities.  Also tell him that you've discovered through research that usually businesses are sold with a working capital adjustment, which is a post-closing true-up to adjust the purchase price.  An average working capital target (current assets minus current liabilities) should have been negotiated as part of the purchase price.\n\nWhen buying a business, buyers write two checks: the purchase price (or down payment) and a working capital deposit into the new business bank account.\n\nFor example, had you set a working capital target before closing and a customer comes in between the target set date and the closing, and paid a $10,000 deposit, and the target is $0, the price should be adjusted by $10,000 in your favor, since the seller takes home the $10,000 and you have to fund it.\n\nI know this is a lot but try this and comment back if you need help.  Everyone talking about suing your attorney or accountant are not terribly experienced with this stuff.  Most attorneys and accountants don't know this stuff, or how to uncover it.

          "body": "What you’re running into isn’t a POS glitch. It’s a timing and ownership issue that just wasn’t visible before.\n\nThose customer deposits weren’t revenue. They were liabilities. The business owed customers either product or a refund. When you bought the business without the cash that came with those deposits, you inherited the obligation but not the money that funded it.\n\nSo in your example:\n\nCustomer pays $5k deposit before you own the business\n\nThat $5k should have been sitting in cash, offset by a customer credit liability\n\nYou didn’t receive that cash at purchase\n\nWhen you complete the sale, you collect the remaining $5k, but you still pay the full $6k vendor bill\n\n\nThat’s why it feels like you “lost” money on each sale. Economically, the loss already existed at purchase — it just shows up over time as you fulfill those orders.\n\nA few important points:\n\n1. You generally can’t recover this from customers. They already paid what they owed.\n\n\n2. This is something to raise with the seller, because those customer credits should have been addressed in the purchase price or paid out at closing. It’s very common for this to be handled as a purchase price adjustment.\n\n\n3. No, you shouldn’t unilaterally subtract $150k from what you owe without talking to a lawyer or CPA, but yes — conceptually, this is exactly the kind of issue that gets netted against seller financing if the contract allows it.\n\n\n4. Going forward, you should track customer deposits explicitly as a liability so this stops being invisible.\n\n\n\nYou didn’t suddenly discover that the business “wasn’t profitable.” You discovered that part of the balance sheet didn’t come with the sale. That’s a painful realization, but it’s also a solvable one once it’s clearly identified.",

Our BCBS rates are going up to 2400 a month with no pre-existing conditions.  The subsidies have expired.  We didn't renew by the Dec 15 in hopes something would get done in Congress because we can still enroll by Jan 15th.  I just do not understand how Health insurance with huge deductibles can actually cost 2400 for 2 people.  My mother who is 76 and lives with me because she has late stage Alzheimers pays 280 a month with Aetna because she was civil service and Federal government subsidizes her healthcare.  She doesnt get Medicare because she didnt pay enough into it but at 280 a month, she is good.  This entire system is a joke.  I feel like I am being punished or farmed.\n\nMy question is what are some other options?  Maybe just catastrophic insurance and then Primary care use cash.  We are trying to save to retire but with Homeowners insurance going up every year as well as Auto insurance and now this.  Its simply unsustainable.\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to add a very weird fact to this all.  One of the many reason i have no trust in insurance companies.  A few years ago Humana pulled out of our county and we had to change insurance providers.  We ask why but in short the reason was they lost money or the zone we live wasnt profitable, blah blah.  The irony when I saw them place 400 piece order with our gift shop later that month.  They obviously are not hurting on money",

          "body": "I don't have any great recommendation for you because the the options are really slim unfortunately. But here is some info:\n\nInsurance companies calculate your premiums according to the following things:\n\n* Your age\n* sex\n* zip code \n* smoker or non smoker\n\nThey use these benchmarks to calculate the risk they are taking by bringing you on board. Your medical conditions don't matter anymore because of you are on an ACA plan. The older you are, the higher the cost. Men are more expensive than women because they have more medical issues the older they get. The insurance companies in the United States exist to make money, so they price everything accordingly. \n\nThe price they come up with for insurance coverage whether you have an ACA plan from the marketplace, a plan from your employer, or even Medicaid and Medicare is the same. The price is the price. \n\nWhat you pay then depends on how much your employer covers, how much the government pays (ACA subsidies or medicaid or medicare). Insurance companies are raising their prices because the cost of healthcare continues to skyrocket and Republicans have decided that they don't want the government to pay for the ACA subsidies anymore, so individuals like your have to pay full price now, which is statistically higher than ever before.\n\nI used to work in insurance and honestly, the catastrophic plans are a scam and really difficult to navigate for someone who is not versed in their exclusions. You could get a private non ACA plan that will look at your medical history to get you approved, that is more affordable than your current plan, but it is not as comprehensive. There's a lot more to explain on how that works, but hopefully you get the gist. \n\nMy recommendation is to just eat the cost and stay fully insured. Being in your 50s with a business and a spouse to worry about, it;s not worth the risk .",

And even if a hospital is going to provide you with the bare minimum and bill you/settle later, that may not be enough to give you the best chance of long life or quality of life.

But all of your employees are performing well and doing what needs to get done? I honestly can't fathom why the salary person is complaining unless this directly impacts them in some way. I'd recommend a flexible schedule with core hours. Like everyone needs to be in the office from 10A-2P, but otherwise make sure you're at every meeting, meeting your benchmarks, and working your 40 hours. Obviously this is industry dependent. Flexibility goes a long way for single people who are responsible for everything in their home to parents with drop offs and pick ups, and everything in between but in my experience flexibility helps retain the best talent the longest.",

It did affect me and our customers when the tardy types were 1-8 minutes late. It wasn’t horrible, but it was annoying.\n\nThe owners tried all kinds of things. Some were clever, some were punitive, some were incentives, they even tried something illegal, until that got shut down. Nothing worked. There was always at least one person late, every single day. And usually 2 or 3, out of staff of about 25. And it was always one or more of the same 8 or so people showing up late. Nothing worked.\n\nFinally, the owner gave up, and quietly approached the half dozen or so of us who were always on time or early, and just asked us to deal with it. For a price. Here, Uncle, here’s a $50 gift card. Hey, a vendor gave me this nice bottle of bourbon, but I don’t drink. You take it. Oh, she needs to leave two hours early today for a doctor’s appointment? We’ll just overlook that and pay her for the entire day. Hey Bob, these widgets aren’t selling, and you mentioned how nice they were. Why don’t you remove them from inventory as a store expense and take them home?\n\nThat was a pretty good system, because the people who were conscientious felt taken care of, and the people who were always late didn’t feel like they were constantly getting in trouble. In fact, it made the late people a little more conscientious, because there wasn’t always someone annoyed at them. It wasn’t a perfect system, but it made the owner think “who can I reward this week” rather than “who do I have to punish this week?”\n\nI still have a nice clock radio I got from that job.",

But then those leads bounce when they hit the site.\n\nThe ad will be specific to their offering with a great hook that gets people interested. \n\nBut then they'll send that lead to the main business website. And that website lists 5 services that don't match the offer. Now the lead is lost and they bounce.\n\nI saw this recently with someone running ads for legal coaching. His ad had a click-through rate that you'd think would generate a 4x or so return on ad spend. But he was barely at 2x. Not at all terrible but was definitely missing out.\n\nWith a separate landing page just for the coaching, the same ad started to perform at a 3x. \n\nThe disconnect is expensive. You're paying for clicks on a specific offer, then confusing people when they land.\n\nIf you're advertising coaching, the landing page should only show coaching. If you're advertising meal prep, only show meal prep.\n\nIt should be this simple:\n\n* What is your offer?\n* Does the page you're sending them to deliver ONLY that thing?\n\nIf not, make a simple landing page first. Even a basic one-pager should perform better than a generic homepage. ",

I am using it the same way small businesses have always used better tools, as a force multiplier that lets me do more with the same amount of time and energy.\n\nAI does not run my business. I do. It helps me draft, research, summarize, sanity check ideas, and move faster through the boring parts so I can spend more time on the work that actually matters. Talking to customers. Making decisions. Building relationships. If anything, it gives me back time to be more human, not less.\n\nThe fear that we will forget how to do things ourselves assumes people blindly outsource their brains. That is a choice, not a requirement. Calculators did not kill math. Spreadsheets did not kill accounting. Email did not kill communication. The people who understand the tool and keep their skills sharp are the ones who benefit. The ones who abdicate responsibility get weaker, and that has always been true with or without AI.\n\nAs for cost and dependency, small businesses already rely on software, platforms, utilities, and vendors every single day. The difference is that AI finally gives small operators leverage that used to require staff or agencies. That is empowering, not dystopian.\n\nIf someone feels overwhelmed by AI hype, the answer is not to reject it outright. The answer is to use it intentionally. AI should make me more capable, not replace me. When used correctly, it is not a crutch. It is a power tool.\n\nA couple of really helpful non-techie books that I like that cover AI are:\n\n“Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/49imjL8\n\n\n“Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/493PobQ",

I had a website, fb business page, LinkedIn, and Houzz, for the 18 years I was in business.  I got  exactly one client off of one of the free platforms. Most of my vendors required a website for opening a reseller account.  So, did I need one, yes. Did it help me get any business, no. I thrived on word of mouth and had very loyal clients that I built relationships with in the 18 years I worked for another company. No I didn't steal any clients. The company closed their doors 4 months after I left, which of course I knew that was coming. \n\nI kept my philosophy  (that I learned, at the age of 21 from a very wise boss, who didn't scoff at me when he asked during my interview where I wanted to be in 5 years and I told him.) of giving the most dependable and knowledgeable service as possible, at the core of my company's mission statement. The clients could get the same products elsewhere but not the same level of service and industry knowledge that I had. I knew I needed to have a niche and there was nothing better than word of mouth. I got clients that were willing to pay for quality, because they saw what I did for others and asked for me. So for b2b, in a small town (pop. 160,000), I definitely did not need a website to get business. All that to say, being distinguished in your field is more important than anything else.\n\nI believe in a much higher population a website would have been useful. I spent way too much money and time on my beautifully visual and professional website. If I knew what I know now, I would just have a one page simple website. Saved some money and a LOT of time. I worked really hard on my website through all 18 years. Really, it was just a money pit. I had to continuously pay more for add-ons and tech support to keep the site running properly. That was in addition to all the other yearly fees.  Well, that doesn't work because you need to buy this other add-on. It never ended.",

Social platforms, marketplaces, and referrals can absolutely generate business. So no, a website isn’t strictly necessary to get started.\n\nBut owning a website is like owning your home.\n\nIt requires a greater upfront investment in time, money, and maintenance. In return, you gain control, stability, and long-term value. Most importantly, you gain intelligence. When you own your website, you own the data. You can see who’s visiting, what they care about, how they convert, and where opportunities are being missed. That insight is very difficult to get when you rely solely on rented platforms like social media or third-party marketplaces.\n\nOver time, that intelligence compounds. It allows you to improve messaging and offers, understand customer behavior, optimize marketing spend, and build a durable brand.\n\nSo while a website may not be required for your small business, it is critical for greater success. If your goal is to grow, learn faster than competitors, and build something you truly own, a website becomes foundational.",

My business also runs its booking services and online sales through our POS platform website. So literally our website is just a landing page that mostly redirects visitors to parts of our POS system and has some About Me sections. However it gives us something permanent with a professional email address to put on business cards. I did have Instagram and Facebook business pages but tried giving those up in January in an effort to improve my mental health and getting off social media. Our store sales plummeted within weeks. I then had to begin rebuilding a new Facebook business page. So I think you DO need to have a website as a foundation that you own the rights to, but you will probably do most customer interactions on social media platforms.",

          "body": "From what I’m seeing, businesses that sit on top of real problems, not hype, will grow the fastest. A few stand out clearly.\n\nAI-enabled services for small and medium businesses will grow quickly. Not flashy AI startups burning cash, but practical automation. Things like customer support, bookings, quoting, finance admin, compliance, marketing, and internal tools. The winners will be the ones that package AI in a simple, trustworthy way and actually save time or money. The big challenge here is trust, data quality, and not overpromising. People are already tired of AI solves everything nonsense.\n\nHealthcare, wellbeing, and ageing-related services are going to explode. Populations are ageing, public healthcare systems are under pressure, and people are more willing to pay privately than ever before. This includes remote monitoring, home care, mental health support, preventative health, and assistive tech. The challenge is regulation, ethics, and delivering real outcomes rather than just apps and subscriptions that don’t move the needle.\n\nCybersecurity and digital trust businesses will grow steadily. As everything moves online and AI makes scams and attacks more convincing, security becomes a non-negotiable cost, not a nice to have. Small businesses are especially vulnerable and under-protected. Growth here will favour firms that simplify security and education, not those that rely on fear. \n\nNiche e-commerce and specialist brands will continue to outperform big generic retailers. People are happy to buy from smaller brands if they feel understood and looked after. This works best where there’s expertise, curation, or a strong story, not just cheaper prices. The challenge is margins, logistics, and not being crushed by ad costs. Community and repeat customers matter more than scale.\n\nEducation and reskilling businesses will grow, especially outside traditional institutions. People know that one career for life is gone. Short, practical learning that leads directly to better income or flexibility will win. This could be technical skills, business skills, or even trades done in smarter ways. The challenge is credibility. Too many courses overpromise and underdeliver, so trust and real-world results are everything.\n\nLocal services that use technology well will quietly do very well. Repair, installation, logistics, home services, and specialist maintenance aren’t going away. Businesses that layer tech, automation, and good customer experience on top of boring but necessary work will be hard to compete with.",

As a franchise expert, I’m constantly looking at these exact trends to see where the \"smart money\" is moving.\n\nIf we look at the next 5–10 years, I see three specific areas that aren't just growing, they're becoming essential:  \n  \nSenior Care &amp; \"Age-in-Place\" Services: With the aging population (Boomers), there is a massive surge in demand for in-home care, senior moving services, and home modifications. It’s a very resilient sector because it’s a necessity, not a luxury.  \nEco-Maintenance &amp; Green Energy: It's no longer just about solar panels. Businesses focusing on EV charging station installation, battery storage, and \"green\" home services (like eco-friendly insulation or HVAC) are going to explode as infrastructure catches up with climate goals.  \nHealth &amp; Personalized Wellness: We’re moving away from \"big box\" gyms toward boutique, specialized health concepts—things like IV hydration, longevity clinics, and tech-enabled mental health services. People are willing to pay a premium for health \"optimization\" rather than just basic fitness.\n\nThe biggest challenge? It’s definitely going to be **labor**. Finding and keeping quality people is the hurdle every business owner faces right now. That’s why systems and automation are so huge, the businesses that win will be the ones that use technology to make their human staff more efficient.\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be building.

I do have enough savings to get by, but the overthinking still kicks in, especially at night. I am continuing to invest in advertising, and I have a strong online presence with good reviews and solid creatives, so the slowdown has been a bit discouraging and confusing.\n\nI am based in Texas, in the U.S., so I am especially curious if others in similar markets are seeing the same thing and how you usually handle slower periods.\n\nAppreciate any insight or shared experiences.

Talking to other vendors, it's that way for everyone from the farmers to the crafters and hot food vendors. My business is a dog bakery. I feel so bad when I see the dogs I know wanting to run over to me but the owners trying to quickly guide them away. Some of them have told me recently they have to watch their spending so they are rationing the treats. I told them to come by and let their dogs get my samples regardless of whether or not they can buy anything. The dogs don't understand keeping a budget. I know they'll buy again when they can. The way things have been going, I'm having to scale back the business to only the weekends and focus on regular work as a web developer and digital marketing - the bakery will just be a hobby business going forward. Fortunately, I am finding some work with digital marketing so I can make it work - this takes the pressure off of the bakery being my sole source of income.

          "body": "I think a lot of the “starting a business is easy” framing comes from people collapsing very different things into one idea.\n\nStarting a business can be simple in the sense that there’s no gatekeeper. You don’t need permission, a boss, or a formal application to try. That lack of friction gets misinterpreted as lack of difficulty.\n\nWhat’s often left out is that simplicity at the start usually trades places with complexity later. The hours, risk, uncertainty, and emotional load don’t disappear, they’re just not front-loaded the way a 9–5 is.\n\nThere’s also survivorship bias and platform incentives at play. People who made it through tend to talk about the freedom and autonomy, while the stress, failed attempts, and long unprofitable stretches don’t perform well on social media.\n\nSo I don’t think most people mean “easy” as in low effort. They mean:\n\nno formal barrier to entry\n\nautonomy instead of structure\n\nupside without a salary cap\n\n\nWhether that’s preferable to a 9–5 really depends on someone’s risk tolerance, financial buffer, and what kind of stress they handle better. For many people, a traditional job is actually the harder-earned stability.\n\nYour instinct is right. Early-stage business ownership is usually harder than a 9–5, just in different ways.

You can't go out and get a new job every day of the week. +1 for business\n\nUncertainty.... see what I wrote about risk above\\^.

For 2 1/2 years I worked 120 hours a week (168 hours in a week) at 5 Burger Kings in Omaha. Once I started my service business I only worked 50-70 hours a week. My friend Susan that is a CFO works about 70+ hours a week and has for 25 years. My wife works about 45 hours a week. Neither Susan or my wife HAVE to, but it's in their blood. But neither could run a business, they admit that. Then I have a sister Linda that works 30 hours a week and is broke all the time. Linda also complains about her job and how broke she is. I've always told Linda if she ever wants to start a business I am here for anything she needs including that first $100.... 35 years later she is still broke and complaining. But to be fair, I'll call this one even as well even though business should get the point.\n\nI made enough money in my service business to retire after 20 years at age 50. Not many 'regular' jobs will do that.\n\nBUT... owning a business is not for everyone. Lots of people are meant to work for someone else and complain about it every day, really. Then when those people get laid off/ fired, they worry and spend countless hours looking for a job and making no money until they finally find another job. But that is how we all grew up and were taught, it's not our fault we were all taught that. \n\nIf I was broke and my business closed today... I could start another service business tomorrow and be making money by the end of the week. Mowing, cleaning houses, washing windows, handyman, junk removal.... what ever it takes if I was broke. \n\nOne trick is to make enough money in your business to be able to pay others to do what you don't want/ like to do.

That part *is* more straightforward than navigating corporate ladders, politics, performance reviews, and permission structures. But execution-wise, it’s usually harder than a 9–5 in almost every dimension you listed: hours, stress, risk, and ambiguity.\n\nThe people framing it as “easy” usually fall into one of three buckets:\n\n* **They’re selling something** (courses, coaching, vibes).\n* **They already crossed the hardest phase** and forgot what it felt like.\n* **They’re confusing autonomy with ease.** Owning your time feels lighter, even if you’re working more.\n\nWhat doesn’t get talked about enough is that early-stage business difficulty isn’t the *work* itself, it’s the cognitive load. You’re the CEO, ops manager, bookkeeper, sales, compliance, and customer support simultaneously. A 9–5 externalizes most of that complexity.\n\nIronically, this is also why so many small businesses struggle long-term. Not because the idea is bad, but because operations never get systematized, so the founder stays stuck carrying everything in their head.\n\nThat’s actually the problem we’re trying to address with Quorum (still in beta). Not making business “easy,” but making the operational side less chaotic once things start working—so founders can build systems instead of just enduring stress. It’s not for everyone, and it doesn’t remove risk, but it helps reduce the constant context-switching that burns people out.\n\nThe honest framing should be: starting a business isn’t easier than a 9–5. It’s just a different kind of hard, and some people prefer *that* kind of hard. For those who do, having real operational structure matters a lot more than the motivational slogans people post online.\n\nIf relevant: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

I was over £14,000 in debt and this genuinely felt like my last shot at turning my life around. I didn’t quit my job or take some blind leap, I kept working a normal job while building the business on the side, I knew absolutely nothing at the start. While working, I listened to podcasts. When I got home, I applied what I’d learned. I made zero sales for the first 3-4 months. But I never viewed that as “failing” I viewed it as building something.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\t•\tFirst year revenue just over £220,000\n\t•\t£110,000 of that in the last 3 months\n\t•\tNo staff (just me and my wife)\n\t•\tI’ve quit my job\n\t•\tPaid off all my debt\n\t•\tBought a house\n\t•\tRetired my wife\n\t•\tBought a car\n\t•\tStarted a second online business 3 months ago that’s already done £25,000\n\t•\tPlanning a third business in January\n\nIs it easy? No.\nIs it anywhere near as hard as some of these comments make out? Also no.\n\nA lot of people talk about taxes, bookkeeping, ads, websites, logistics etc as if they’re insurmountable obstacles, they're not, they’re just skills you learn over time. Problems don’t disappear, but you solve them as they arise.\n\nToday I work 2-3 hours a day. Problems still happen, but I’d much rather fix occasional issues for this level of reward than work 10 hour days to earn in a week what I now make in half a day.\n\nIf I had read comments like many of these before starting, I probably wouldn’t have tried and that would have cost me everything I have today.\n\nStarting a business isn’t “easy”, but it’s also not this impossible, soul destroying nightmare people describe I have more freedom now in my life than I've ever had. Most people fail not because it’s too hard, but because they quit before the compounding effect kicks in.\n\nFor the person who asked the original question,\nDon’t let other people’s fear decide for you, take the very small risk whilst working a normal job and learn, you'll find out very quickly if it is or isn't for you.",

Trading a boss for responsibility, building something you control, and betting on yourself can feel lighter than a job that drains you, even if it’s harder on paper.\n\nSo yeah, anyone can start a business, but not everyone should, and it’s definitely not the “easy” path.",

The entrance is very narrow — only one person can pass through at a time. Recently, a homeless man who appears to be an addict has been repeatedly hanging around the front door and blocking the entrance.\n\nYesterday, the situation escalated badly. When my dad asked him to leave and move away from the entrance, the man refused and stood in the doorway shouting and screaming for about 10 minutes straight. He was making obscene gestures (including repeatedly pointing at his genitals), yelling aggressively, and would not leave despite repeated requests.\n\nAt one point, he appeared to aim toward the window as if he might break it. My dad raised his voice and asked him not to. The man then made explicit death threats, repeatedly gesturing slitting/stabbing motions at his neck and threatening to kill my dad. This continued for several minutes.\n\nTwo passersby eventually stopped and helped by yelling at the man until he finally left. My dad even pretended to call the police at one point, but it had no effect. We have videos of the incident, and it’s honestly disturbing. For context, my dad is in his late 60s, and the business is in West Hollywood blvd, Los Angeles. \n\nWhat’s more concerning is that this wasn’t a one-time event:\n\n\t•\tThe man showed up earlier that morning and again later in the evening\n\n\t•\tOne time, my dad gave him a box of biscuits and asked him to leave, and he did\n\n\t•\tBut later that night, he returned and became aggressive again\n\n\t•\tHe seems to be a regular presence in the area and keeps coming back\n\nTo be clear: this is not about being anti-homeless or refusing help to people in need. The issue is that he repeatedly blocks the entrance, refuses to move or leave, becomes verbally aggressive, and has now made direct violent threats.\n\nMy concern is safety — especially if he comes back and follows through on those threats.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tWhat is the appropriate course of action in a situation like this- when it becomes threatening?\n\n\t•\tIs calling the police the only realistic option, or are there other steps that help?\n\n\t•\tHow do you handle this in a way that protects the business and the people inside without escalating things?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be really appreciated.",

Still do this.\n\nMeantime, make your business as unattractive as possible for homeless people.  Do not EVER feed, give drinks or allow them to charge their phones at your business.  You're not being kind, you're establishing that you are their new favorite hangout place.  This is bad.  If you want to be charitable, do that by donating to the shelter or other services that happen away from your store.  Make sure all outside electrical outlets and hose spigots are locked.\n\nWhile you should never, ever physically assault anyone, you can also make the environment less hospitable.  Install an outdoor speaker for music.  Next time someone is hanging out in the doorway blocking it, turn on the music to an uncomfortable level.  Play something annoying.  Your choice - Baby Shark, classical, jazz, whatever you think might be annoying.\n\nMany of the homeless people are paranoid.  Install outdoor cameras even if the cameras are fake or don't record.  Make sure the camera is obvious - a blinking red light is helpful here.  Have signs up that say the area is under video surveillance.  If possible, have a recording you can play when needed.  Something like \"You are being monitored.\"  \n\nKeep the outside and front of your store spotless.  Pick up every speck of trash.  Although it has a subtle effect, people are more inclined to gravitate to the setting where they fit in.  The types of customers you want will feel more comfortable in the clean setting and the types of people you don't want will feel out of place.  \n\nIf this homeless person returns, you may want to hire a security guard temporarily.  You just want to move this person along a few times and break them of the habit of coming to your store.  Encourage them to find other sources of biscuits and shelter.",

Simple omemade goodies or a small tin of swedish butter cookies from the store can be a great ice breaker, especially this week during Christmas. For you and your dad, aways smiling and simply say Hi to the neighbors is also a great icebreaker. Even if they aren't friendly at first, eventually they'll come around because they'll remember you guys as the smiling neighbors. \n\n* Give your dad a simple script he can use in English to say to the person blocking the door in case they return: \n(From chatgpt again:\n\n“This is private property.\nYou must leave now.”\n\nIf they do not leave or continue yelling:\n“If you do not leave, I will call the police.”\n\nThen stop speaking and make the call if it continues. \n\n📞 Script for calling 911\n“I own a store.\nThere is a man blocking my entrance.\nHe is yelling and being obscene.\nI am afraid.”\n\nIf needed:\n“I do not speak English well.

It's one of the big advantages of owning your own business and if you're not doing it that's a ton of money on the table. Save the receipt, write on it what it was for, save it in your bookkeeping software to reference if you ever get audited. This applies to literally any reasonable expense that could be justified as marketing costs that would not have happened if you didn't own a business. Reasonable means reasonable - client gifts absolutely count, but not if the gift is like... a jet ski or if your client is actually your aunt. Buying things they ask you to buy is even more clear cut - I would even say you're in the right to charge your client for milage and hours doing this. I wouldn't charge clients but definitely should be writing off that milage involved at the IRS milage tax rate.\n\n\nFyi - you don't need to charge to a biz card to do this. All that matters is the receipt. A business card isn't anything special - it a normal credit card in every sense of the word except one that is marketed towards businesses. You can write off stuff on your personal card and you can charge personal items to a business card, the IRS or the banks don't care at all. It just makes your life easier knowing that your business card truly only has business transactions on it, which is especially important if you have employees.",

The bits about the LLC as mentioned below really don't play into your situation as you don't have anything to really be protected from, you driving to and from and your management decisions will not be absolved by the LLC if something occurs. Good insurance on the other hand is vital! Just make sure you add line items to your invoices of Items Purchased for Client (or something to that accord) and tag it out as a separate line item so your end of year taxes will be cleaner because you can tie the COGS to that specific Revenue, quick and clean. Document everything because you can add mileage and other expenses due to the nature of delivery and get a pretty nice chunk deducted for that as well, presuming you own the vehicle and not the company.",
