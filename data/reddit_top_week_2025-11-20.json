I was scrolling through Instagram and saw some lifestyle bloggers with decent followings but their websites were... rough. Slow loading times, no internal linking, missing alt tags - basic stuff that kills their Google rankings. So I sent a few DMs. Something like: *\"Hey, love your content! Just checked your site and noticed a few quick fixes that could boost your traffic. Would you be interested in a site optimization? I can have it done this week.\"*\n\nThe response rate shocked me. Out of 10 messages, 2-3 people responded interested. They were RELIEVED someone reached out. Most of them know their site has issues but have no idea how to fix it or think it'll cost thousands.\n\nWhat I actually do:\n\n* Run their site through free tools (PageSpeed Insights, Screaming Frog)\n* Fix image compression and lazy loading\n* Add internal links between their posts (I use help of AI for this - automates the whole thing in like 5 mins)\n* Update meta descriptions and titles\n* Fix broken links\n* Find ideas for content (thanks to competitors analysis which is also performed by this tool)\n\nTotal time: 20-30 minutes per site. Charge: $100. The best part?\n\nThese bloggers are genuinely happy. Their sites load faster, they start seeing better rankings, and they think I'm some kind of wizard. Meanwhile I'm literally just following a checklist I learned from YouTube.\n\nI'm doing 4-5 of these per week now. That's an extra $400-500 for maybe 3 hours of actual work (not counting the hours spent looking for such guys)\n\nI can't tell you where and how exactly I find these people because honestly, I don't need more competition in my niche 😂 But let's just say there are platforms where content creators hang out and complain about their website problems...\n\nMy advice if you want to try this:\n\n1. Learn basic SEO fixes (literally just watch a few YouTube videos)\n2. Find people with content but bad websites\n3. Reach out professionally, don't be spammy\n4. Deliver quick results\n5. Ask for testimonials to build credibility\n\nThe barrier to entry is incredibly low. You don't need to be an expert - you just need to know slightly more than the person you're helping.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar? Or am I the only opportunist here taking advantage of people's laziness to Google things? 😅",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been trying to make money online for a while now, and honestly I’ve tested like 10 different things. Most of them either paid basically nothing or took forever to see any results. I kept jumping from idea to idea because everyone online makes it look so easy, but when you actually try it, it’s a whole different story. Being a student doesn’t help either, I barely have time and I’m always broke, so I needed something that actually works without a bunch of start-up costs.\nAfter trying all that stuff, only a few things ended up giving me real payouts. Making short little brand videos on Methods app has been surprisingly decent, I’m not some influencer or anything, but the beginner tasks still pay something. I also started putting simple digital templates on Etsy, and I sell small guides and checklists on Gumroad whenever I have time to make new ones. And when I need quick tiny cash, KashKick fills in the gaps, even if it’s not a lot. These aren’t huge money makers, but when you stack them together, it’s actually helped me get through the last couple months.\nI’m still learning and trying things though, because I kinda need every extra dollar I can get right now. If anyone else is also doing low-effort or beginner-friendly online stuff that pays even a little, I’d love to hear what’s been working for you. I’m really just trying to survive school without going completely broke lol.",

Any time you see anyone advertising or doing anything.  Ask yourself, why are they doing that, how does that work, how hard is it to do that exact thing?  Talk to real people you know.  Chances are they like you and will tell you what they’re up to.  All those people living around you in a big city…they’re all making money…and it’s not just a full-time job.  Be observant.  And once people find a profitable side hustle, the last thing they want are copycats so they do not post it online.  But it does take imagination, brainpower and often learning new skills.  Just don’t let your brain hold you back.  Never let your brain tell you that you could never do that for whatever reason.  With all the free learning tools out there these days there’s literally nothing that you can’t figure out.  If you see an AD online that says ‘Make Money Easy Online’.  Don’t fall for it.  The person posting that AD is the only one making money.  You can try copying what they’re doing if you want.  But don’t buy what they’re trying to sell.",

Did that for 5 years. YouTube ad revenue sharing I got about $100 a month. If lucky maybe around $200. Some affiliate sales but that was really hard to get people to click on the link. YouTube videos every week or several a week is hard to maintain. Burnt out with it. In the end I just felt defeated. Not saying to give up or not try. If you want to go for it.

Things like cleaning services, pet care, or mobile car detailing can work really well in the UK market.. lower overhead than retail and you can often start small and scale up.\n\nThe property thing - yeah i get why you're hesitant there. But service businesses are different because you're not tied to expensive real estate. One thing I'd suggest is looking at businesses where you can test the concept first before going all in. Like if you're thinking about a cleaning franchise, maybe try running a small independent version for a few months to see if you even like managing crews and dealing with customers. That way your £10k goes toward actually validating the idea instead of just jumping in blind.",

      "selftext": "If you’re looking for a high-leverage side hustle in 2025, I genuinely think building a micro SaaS is the move. You don’t need VC money, a team, or years of coding experience anymore.\n\nHere’s the formula:\n\nFind a problem you’ve personally experienced, something annoying that costs you time or energy, and build a solution around that inside of Lovable. It’ll handle all the SaaS boilerplate for you, so you can focus on the actual product. Use Supabase for your backend and Stripe for payments. That’s your foundation sorted.\n\nNow when it comes to marketing, this is where most people go wrong. The first 30 days should be 100% organic. That looks like:\n\n1. Reddit posts that don’t feel like plugs. Ask questions or share your story in communities related to your niche. Don’t sell, just spark discussion.\n\n2. Reddit replies under competitor mentions. Add real value to existing threads; people will click through naturally.\n\n3. YouTube comment placements. Leave thoughtful comments under videos where your target users hang out.\n\n4. Short-form videos. Post simple slideshows or product demos daily on TikTok, Reels, and Shorts, like “top 5 controversial things I learnt about XYZ” \n\n5. AI UGC videos. Use an avatar or voiceover to share your product demo with a catchy hook like “Can’t believe this tool does X.”\n\n6. Green screen memes. “POV: you realised [pain your product solves]” it’s quick, relatable, viral.\n\n7. Standing avatar + wall of text. Static background, emotional or relatable text overlay; crazy watch time, easy to make.\n\nThese plays can bring your first 100 users without spending a cent on ads. Stack them daily, and you’ll start building real momentum fast.\n\nBtw you can run these marketing strategies inside something like Canva or Aftermark AI ",

They handle global taxes, invoicing, and compliance automatically so beginners don’t get stuck on the accounting part.\n\nBut overall, your marketing breakdown is on point,  most people underestimate how far consistent organic content can take them.",

I'd love to share them with people, but I'm not sure 1,000 rows of unstructured notes would do anyone much good. \n\nSo I'm curious: if you could subscribe to a newsletter/podcast that shares new ideas in a short-form, easy-to-follow format, what would you like to see included?

          "body": "In today’s world, financial pressure on young adults is undeniable. The rising cost of education, housing, and general living expenses, combined with the desire for financial independence, has made a single source of income feel insufficient. Fortunately, the modern economy, powered by technology and connectivity, has opened up countless opportunities to earn extra money. For young adults, this \"side hustle\" culture isn't just a trend; it's a practical way to build savings, pay down debt, or simply afford a better quality of life. The methods available are vast, ranging from flexible app-based gigs to monetizing unique personal skills online.\nThe most accessible entry point for many is the gig economy. This term refers to the ecosystem of apps and platforms that connect workers directly with customers for short-term, on-demand jobs. Think of services like Uber and Lyft for ridesharing, or DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber Eats for food and grocery delivery. These jobs are popular for a reason: the barrier to entry is low, and the scheduling is incredibly flexible, allowing you to work around classes or another job. Beyond delivery, platforms like Rover and Wag connect animal lovers with pet-sitting and dog-walking gigs, while TaskRabbit allows you to get paid for helping people with moving, furniture assembly, or yard work. While this work provides immediate income, it can be inconsistent and is often tied to your location and the time you're willing to put in.\nFor those with specific digital skills, the world of online freelancing offers a path to higher-paying and more career-focused work. Young adults, often \"digital natives,\" are uniquely positioned to excel here. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr have created global marketplaces where you can sell your talents. If you are a strong writer, you can get paid for writing blog posts, website copy, or social media updates. If you have an eye for design, you can create logos, social media graphics, or presentations for businesses. Other in-demand skills include video editing, programming, and even administrative tasks as a \"virtual assistant,\" helping busy professionals manage their email and schedules from afar. This route not only provides income but also builds a professional portfolio, which can be invaluable for your future career.\nIf you have a more entrepreneurial or creative spirit, you might explore the creator and e-commerce economy. This involves building a brand or business online. One popular path is e-commerce, which can be as simple as \"thrifting\" or finding unique clothing and reselling it on platforms like Depop, Poshmark, or eBay. If you are crafty, you can open an Etsy shop to sell handmade goods, art, or even digital products like resume templates, photo-editing presets, or planners. On the creator side, platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch allow you to build an audience around a passion, whether it's gaming, cooking, or education. While it is a slow process, a dedicated following can be monetized through ad revenue, brand sponsorships, and selling merchandise. This path requires patience and consistency, as you are building an asset, not just trading time for money.\nFinally, it’s important not to overlook the power of traditional, local services. Not every side hustle has to be high-tech. There is always a reliable demand for in-person skills. If you excel in a particular subject, academic or music tutoring is a classic and well-paying option. Babysitting and nannying remain in high demand, offering steady, reliable income. Other valuable local services include house cleaning, landscaping, car washing, or offering tech support to less tech-savvy neighbors, like helping seniors set up their smartphones or computers. These jobs often pay in cash and help you build a strong reputation within your community, leading to consistent work through word-of-mouth referrals.\nUltimately, the best method for earning extra money depends entirely on your personal skills, available time, and financial goals. The gig economy offers speed and flexibility, while freelancing builds a valuable portfolio. E-commerce and content creation provide a path to building your own brand, and local services offer reliable, community-based income. The key is to recognize that your time and skills have value. By exploring these options, you can move beyond relying on a single paycheck and take active control of your financial future.",

      "selftext": "Truth be told, building anything passive was never the grand plan. I just got so incredibly tired of having to start from absolute zero, every single time I tried something new.\n\nIt all began with this super simple habit. Whenever I made something that actually sold, I'd literally just remake it three different ways - new colors, different titles, tiny tweaks. I wasn't trying to be clever or strategic, I just, honestly, didn't want my shop to look completely empty. Then, a few weeks later, it hit me: those duplicate listings were ranking all on their own, quietly pulling in random sales while I was off doing, well, anything else.\n\nThe same phenomenon extended to Pinterest. I'd published a few pins, then promptly disregarded them, only to find them consistently driving traffic. Medium echoed this experience, an article composed long ago continued to accrue views. It became apparent: any content or asset that formed a connection to another element within my ecosystem maintained its efficacy without active management.\n\nRecognizing this, I intentionally cultivated these connections. Currently, my Etsy listings direct to my blog, which in turn links back to the shop, with Pinterest serving as a feeder for both. This isn't sophisticated, but it creates a continuous loop. Consequently, the system remains operational even during periods of disengagement.\n\nThis isn't the result of complex automation. Instead, it operates on a principle akin to 'digital gravity', initial momentum in one area organically attracts and propels related components, sustaining a continuous flow.\n\nMy former belief was that sustaining my hustle required perpetual motivation. The reality proved to be simpler: I merely needed to establish systems robust enough to function independently of my energy levels. Now, I frequently awaken to small sales, monitor traffic, and feel a sense of contentment knowing the underlying mechanics continue to operate discreetly.\n\n",

Alongside my full-time job, I have always traded in domain names. I have successfully sold many domains, such as hond.nl, fietsenwinkel.nl and many more. For over twenty years, I’ve earned an extra monthly income this way. Sometimes I made €3,000, but usually between €1,000 and €1,500 per month by buying and selling domain names.\n\nHowever, the past year has been very disappointing because there are very few good names left with extensions like .com, .eu and .nl. I was actually thinking about quitting… until I had a conversation with a colleague who emigrated to Dubai. He told me that the .ae extension is becoming increasingly popular among locals and  many international companies due to tourism growth.\n\nEspecially in the real estate sector, .ae domains are used more and more to build trust when selling expensive villas. You can easily buy .com or .nl domains anywhere, which has led to a lot of scammers. A .ae domain, on the other hand, is harder to obtain and requires passport verification before the government approves the registration (you don´t need to have a pasport-ID from the emirates, you just need to have an ID and that´s it.. I live in the Netherlands and that´s also fine.\n\nSo I decided to give it a try. In the first weeks I invested €360, because through hosts like OnlyDomains you pay around €36 per year for a .ae domain. I immediately bought the domains palmjumeirahvillas.ae and palmjumeirahhotels.ae. Within a week I sold them simply by emailing real estate companies with an offer.\n\nIn the first month I earned €9,800, and the month after that €15,600. It continued like that for a while. Recently, I’ve noticed that competition is increasing and profits are slightly lower, so I started flipping: I bought domains I had previously owned again and resold them within a week with a 60% margin. In the end, I’ve now made €100,000 and I’m enjoying my time alongside my job even more.\n\nI hope young, driven entrepreneurs read this and find some motivation. There are so many opportunities as long as you think of a good idea and apply it to a niche that is rapidly growing. Follow the market! We can clearly see that the housing market in Dubai is extremely popular, so we respond to that.\n\nI wish you all a wonderful evening and lots of success.",

Almost every business today needs video content for marketing, whether it is Instagram reels, TikTok shorts, YouTube videos, or website promos. The demand is huge and growing.\n\nYou don’t need to be a filmmaker. You can learn basic editing in a week. The only part most beginners struggle with is doing voiceovers, but that problem is basically solved now because you can use AI voiceover tools and get clean, natural narration without recording anything yourself.\n\nOnce you know how to put together short promotional videos, product demos, before-and-after videos, or service explainers, you can sell monthly content bundles to small businesses. For example:\n\n10 short videos per month  \n2 long videos per month  \nA full video reel pack  \nSocial media formatted clips\n\nBusinesses love it because they need fresh content constantly, and you can deliver it quickly once you have a workflow. This skill is simple, fast to learn, and can become steady income because businesses often stay with you month after month.\n\nI also explain how to make voiceovers easily in my newsletter, link in my bio if you want more details.",

          "body": "I've been making a couple hundred each month just by looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than the cost. It's called bonus arbitrage. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

      "selftext": "Major info from my last post first- (Posted 2 months ago)\n\n—-\n\nSo I got to know I have a severe heart condition in January that needed an urgent procedure to happen in order for me to live. I got it done, lots of paranoia and a long recovery made me try out a few major online side hustles as I took a long break from my job. Here’s what worked for me and can work for you too!\n\nActual Book Publishing (Amazon KDP)-  So writing has been my passion since a long time and I had this fairytale story written from like the past 2 years, so I gave it a try and published it with a nice cover and a little self done social media marketing it cost me $500 total to format it, cover artists and some social media posts. It’s earning 100$/month since! I have another book planned but won’t publish it until next year.\n\nNext was Ebooks, simply taking a burning issue or a very niche idea and creating a how to guide (purely Chatgpt) but NOT AI SLOP! Something that has value and people use it. I made 2 books and felt it was a bit boring for me, it costed me 100$/book and I made like 20$ from each till now. This literally has a huge potential if done properly and genuinely you can make 10-15 books a month, even if 1 blows up you are set for life!\n\nFacebook Pages- So a little background, in the place I worked I used to manage a lot of pages like this (this was pre facebook monetisation era) but as FB started monetising content even pictures and text posts, It became a full blown business! As I was off from work I focused on one page of my own and grew it to almost 100k followers in 6 months (it had 10k in Jan)\n\nThis page earns me almost $1000, every month since March and it’s only increasing. The only thing I do is make 5 posts a day, literal photos and maybe some graphics like quote posters every once in a while.\n\nYouTube - This has been my favourite! So there’s a very good niche of explainer videos that you must have seen! It’s just simply explaining stuff that’s interesting. It maybe sports, Entertainment, movies, science, money anything! I myself preferred motorsports so I went with that! This month is my 3rd month being monetised and I earned around $3000 till today (I started in July End, monetised in Sep 1st Week) This thing helped me find potential people who wanted to do the same thing and as I recruited a lot of video editors for myself I asked them to work with me with a few bucks overcharge (If I pay 50 for a 15 min video I ask $60) and this helped me earn a $200 from my first client.\n\nSo yeah! That’s pretty much it, I will be uploading proofs in comments if People want, I just wanted to post this and let people know that there is always light at the end of the tunnel and if you are willing to work and maybe spend a little money, the universe has a great way of returning it in multiple folds!\n\nNow Update- (I have helped 3 people who are doing Facebook, 2 are doing Youtube with me) Now the monthly earnings are increasing to almost $3k in profits (1k from facebook, $2k from YouTube, around $100 from books)\n\nAlso, I am walking regularly now… little steps… I know but We will get there soon! \n\nSo ama I guess, I will try to help out as many people as I can, just like last time :)",

          "body": "A decent side hustle I've been doing is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

Hours are weird, pay is meh, and I spend half my day telling people their membership expired.\n\nFrom May to Oct, I chased \"passive income.\" Spoiler: nothing about it was passive.\n\n**What flopped:**\n\nReselling sneakers - Took Ls on every drop. Bought 2 pairs nobody wanted. Sold 1 at a loss. Net: –$142.\n\nAir fryer recipes on TikTok - Posted daily for a month. Got 3k views total. One dude commented \"mid.\" Earned $0.\n\nDigital planners - Spent $70 on \"premium fonts.\" Sold 0. My cousin downloaded the sample for free and never said thanks.\n\nSurvey apps - 40 minutes for $1.20. Deleted all of them out of self-respect.\n\n**What actually paid (tiny but real):**\n\nPhone repair gigs - Replaced cracked screens. Charged $40–$60 each. Made \\~$260 after buying tools.\n\nCleaning two Airbnbs - Found on Facebook groups. $55 per clean, did 5 in two months. Total: $275 and a sore back.\n\nTask Monkey (Chrome extension) - Tried it during Prime Day. Got $82 back from random Amazon price drops with zero effort. Literally the closest thing to \"passive\" I touched.\n\n5 months in, I don't trust the \"make money in your sleep\" people.\n\nEverything that paid required sweat, messages, or driving across town.\n\nThe \"passive\" stuff? Mostly vibes and disappointment.\n\nIf you've found something real that isn't a course, a flip, I'm listening.",

Don't know how this will work, but it's an idea.\n\nIn 2018, I helped do a journalism piece on modern slavery  for the show Ecologic on 99.5 WBAI Radio, NYC. I was researching for slavery in the palm oil industry, their enslavement  of people and environmental degradation from the plantations, but when you research,  you find other stuff. One of them was fake designer bags. They force slaves to make the bags with lead. The buyer slowly dies of lead poisoning because the dust is either inhaled,  absorbed through skin, or if you're a nail biter, through the mouth. The slaves can be children of hide and seek age. I had nightmares doing this story.\n\nSo, keeping stuff out of the landfill,  making designer goods cheap enough to compete with fakes, while helping the slaves and giving me pocket money  might be the answer to solve a horrific problem. Still learning how to do this , but there are bag flippers out there making a living. Might as well try.",

          "body": "One thing I've been doing is bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

I’ve built relationships with people in my network that I know manages warehouses and most time I get the pallets for cheap (less than a $1) and sell them to pallet company’s for $4 who recycles it and sells it back for $7.

          "body": "You can try bonus arbitrage, which can probably make you a couple hundred each month. Basically, you look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been doing KDP since August of 2024, a little over a year now. I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, crypto, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot and learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light PM Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain you level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

Its not that I cannot do it, its just that I wish I didnt have to.

I have many questions for you, hope you'll take a bit if your precious time to answer my questions.\n\n1) For this one, it's not really for you but for those commenters that saying you're using AI or you gave vague answers. I need to push it at no 1 because I don't think those people will have energy to read my essay till the end. Well, if they read, so here :\n\nIt's funny and sad how you saw this long ass explanations that you can't fathom what they're talking about, but still want to leave something so that the OP can experience a tenth of your miserable life by commenting that they're using AI or focusing on their vague answer eventhough actually their answer is make sense eventhough not straighforward, if you can read comprehensively.\n\n2) Now back to the topic. Most of your points eg: using ads and outsorcing the books, I'd assume you start to use those when you hit with good enough revenue. May I know how you started getting your first sale? Did you list the books and then wish for the best or you use ads from the start? Is it possible to just list out our product and just wait until some people interested to buy it? Or we still need to do some promotion? How about initial review, did you applly that for your book or you let review grew organically?\n\n3) You have more than 100 books, may I know if all of those from the same niche or different ones? If different, do you separate to different pen names that suitable for those niches or combine it under the same pen name?\n\n4) What software /system / service that you use for creating the low and medium content, and also high content. Eg: for high content youd need software or something to rearrange the format to make as book is it?\n\n5) As for the pricing, how would you decide the price? Based on content, word counts or pages? Eg for price 14.99, is it must be within 100 pages (for low content) and like 30k words (for high content)? What's your standard in pricing?\n\n6) Do you focusing on physical books or also ebook /audiobook? If including ebook and audiobook, do you have plan to create your own website to sell those? I mean, you'd increase the margin or something right?\n\n7) Are all your books use ISBN from Amazon or you bought your own? Would you keep using amazon kdp for it's trafic and book logistic convenience or you might venture out for proper publication?\n\n8) What's your opinion on untapped niches? Do you think it's untapped for a reason aka low or no demand, or it's still undiscovered because it's combination of different niches so it's a hard for people who's copying what niche works to create their own opportunity?\n\nI really appreciate it if you could answer all my curiosities. I'm interested to start amazon KDP with too much ideas but too little time and courage kinda hold me back. But reading your post make me think that it's not impossible for me to just start. Thank you for your time.\n\nP/s : sorry if there's any grammar mistake or whatever some people gonna be picky about, English is not my first language.",

Dollar-cost averaging beats market timing - You invest the same amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares. When prices are low, you buy more. Over time, this averages out your purchase price and removes emotional decision-making.  \n  \n2. Low-cost index funds beat active management - Over 90% of active fund managers underperform the market over 15+ years (check the SPIVA scorecards yourself). Index funds track the entire market with fees around 0.1-0.3% annually instead of 1-2%+ for active funds. That difference compounds massively.  \n  \n3. Time in market beats timing the market - Historical data shows staying invested through crashes outperforms trying to predict them. The market has always recovered. Always.",

Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

You have to commit yourself against any kind of fun for a while, but eventually your mind changes and it gets easier.\n\nYou’ll see friends going to bars, clubs, fun, and festivals. Some won’t talk with you anymore because you can’t do what they are. you’ll miss trips, you won’t take vacation, you’ll not get kids important to you the exact thing you wanted. You’ll be embarrassed. You’ll have to eat the free lunch anytime it’s available. You’ll need to not eat out, clip coupons, make your own coffee, not get a convenient snack at the gas station. You have to be a little hungry til you’re home. Going somewhere for fun? It’s the park with your feet.\n\nYou’ll do this for a minimum of three years, and the rest of the world will be having a WAY better time.\n\nYear one starts slow. Agonizing. It’s $10 to a broker account a week. Maybe $50 if things went alright. Your friends are hitting you up but you’re not going. Month goes by. You’re suddenly craving your favorite Chinese spot, and damn you have $200 extra, can’t you slide some over? NO. You can’t. Because you looked up some monthly dividend-payers and that $200 is about to pay you $5. That Amazon movie you want to see is $4.99, perfect! FUCK NO.\n\nYou’re 6 months in, damn, you were able to save a grand, where did that come from? You can afford a little splurge, right? There’s a charter that’s $180 to take you fishing and you just got paid - why don’t you go? Well now your $5 dividend-paying stock that cost you $200 had some NAV erosion and it’s $185. You make the painful smart choice to buy another. Single. Stock. Because now you’re making another whole $5 this month and it was $15 off.\n\nAbout this point you realize how expensive it is to actually buy your own time back. So you start running the numbers. You want $10/hr? Congrats you have now accumulated around $1400 in your $5 dividend-paying account spread across 7 total stocks. You have bought yourself 3.5 hours of work at $10/hr.\n\nYou realize no one can live on $10/hr without support, and life really wants around $25-30.\n\nYou really only gained an hour, it’s November. Christmas is coming, last Christmas sucked, you have over a grand, your partner is upset you’re not living like everyone else… but you *did* get an extra hour of work out of every month.\n\nNext year, you try harder, you get a second job. You diversify. You find there are weekly payers. You get them for a quick dopamine hit. it’s good for a bit to see that cash every week. Then someone on TV says something they don’t mean and your portfolio tumbles, you stopped your steady $5/month payer and had it all in weekly payers, you got greedy and didn’t know what you were buying, so you cash out, taking a little tax hit and bruising your ego. You’re kicking yourself, you don’t want to tell your partner you just set yourself back two months.\n\nJust then, new tech! Your weeklies raise and you’re already out. You want back but you know better, and two weeks later, you were glad you didn’t buy the news, it’s crashed even lower.\n\nYou feel smart, but you couldn’t have really known though. You’re more uncertain, your money is in the hands of billionaires through your broker. They don’t give a shit about you. They could wipe your account at any time (it’s in the terms but you didn’t read them at first).\n\nYou start to realize you need custody, that is your money. You learn about Direct Registration, where shares are ACTUALLY held in your name - under your SSN, not a broker. We’re rolling up on the third year here….\n\nYou now own your shares. The company you bought them from issues you a check now for the dividends, or reinvests it. You’re making steady gains, you’re buying dips, you’re making a hundred extra a month. You bought 3-4 hours of your time back and it only took 3 years! \n\nNow everything looks different. You don’t go to the weed shop and get two cartridges, you don’t smoke at all because that’s cutting into paying yourself faster. You’ve actually dropped a few habits because they were expensive.\n\nAll your friends are broke and complaining, you’re just quiet because you stacked - but you’re still not done… because in just a few months you’re on your way to $185 a month in dividends, which you’re putting right towards those nice stocks that always hang around $180, and FINALLY you’re getting some compounding.\n\nAnd you still can’t spend that because God only knows what’s around the corner.\n\nIt can be done, it’s FUCKING HARD.\n\nI don’t do much in stocks anymore, I took a good chunk of what I made (except long term plays) and mine Bitcoin now, but you didn’t want promotion, so there’s a stock story.",

So maybe ten minutes of work per month. I rode this wave for about three years until I sold the business.\n\nHOWEVER, I spent about 18 months before that creating the (digital) products, running ads, building a facebook group and email list, and promoting in any way I could. It was a ton of work.\n\nDo I still think this is possible? Absolutely. But I think for 99.9% of the population, you’ve gotta either put in the work or put in the money before you can get the returns. There are no shortcuts, unless you are in the .01% and just happen to get lucky with whatever ‘thing’ you do.",

You spend a month or two fixing it up after your normal job’s workday (which I actually find fun bc it is grounding and I live in my head too much with my job).   Then you rent it out. Yes a/c’s break. Roofs leak. Plumbing gets backed up. Often at inconvenient times. \n\nBut partly what makes those repairs a pain is that for the most part for months at a time, you’re not doing anything to or for a property. It actually is so passive it makes you lazy.  Then at the height of your comfort or laziness, a toilet backs up. Big deal, you call a plumber or you try to fix it yourself. \n\nAnyway, just want to point out that work you like doing is itself sort of passive. So be sure to search for that too…",

Social media things, apps, or e-books seem to be posted often, but that’s not passive at all. Like if you make an app then you’re a literal developer. That’s a job. If you write a book then you’re a writer. If you’re a social media influencer then you’re an entertainer.  \n\nI would argue that just because something provides residual income doesn’t make it passive, and many things still require pretty significant upkeep even after they’re “launched.”  \n\nAs others have said, traditional investments like stocks, dividends, and CDs are truly the most passive thing I can think of, but that of course requires a nest egg of money to start with. \n\nThat being said, it’s much easier to make money from a regular job and then dump it into a stable dividend stock than it is to learn how to write a book or an app if you don’t have any experience with that sort of thing.",

Every business today needs video content for Instagram, TikTok, ads, and even Google listings. Restaurants, barbershops, gyms, coffee shops, real estate agents, and online stores all need simple videos to promote their services.\n\nThe good thing is that you do not need to film anything yourself. You can use stock footage, templates, and AI tools to create professional looking videos quickly. The part that used to be the most difficult, the voiceover, is now solved easily with AI voiceover tools, so you can generate clean narration without recording anything.\n\nYour computer becomes your production machine. You can offer monthly video bundles to local businesses, and many will pay because they always need fresh content.\n\nThis is far more profitable and realistic than trying to use your PC for mining.\n\nI also explain more in my blog posts.

The process is very straightforward. Start by choosing a good niche. Animals are always a reliable option. Gather a collection of images online, then use a conversion website to turn them into clean line art. You can bundle these designs and sell them on Etsy or in Facebook groups.\n\nOffering custom work can be even more profitable. You can convert customers’ personal photos into line art for a higher fee. The site I use costs about ten cents per conversion, and you can charge a few dollars for premade bundles or five to fifteen dollars for custom conversions.\n\nYou can also do seasonal images like a bunch of different characters for Xmas for example",

      "selftext": "so I want to share just an idea of mine for making money, this is just a theoretical idea, I did NOT test it and not sure if you really can make money with it, theoretically you should be able...\n\nI’m sure all of us get a lot of spam emails... a cousin from Nigeria that left you some big money, you're a winner of some kind of lottery, Bitcoin earning... and many of them... and all of these spam emails either want you to download something (never do not download) OR just want you to send them something, like photo of bank account, credit card... or other things.\n\nso my idea is related to those spam emails that expect from you some response with files/images...\n\nI like to call it \"spam a spammer\"\n\nso like steps to do:\n\n1. Create a totally new email account (gmail I think is the best, and never do NOT use your real email)\n2. Expose your email publicly, so like write your email on any kind of forum, blogs... everywhere... so main idea here is for spammer parsers to find your email and just include it in their spam list. Here you could focus on niche, like expose email just on money maker forums for example\n3. Find some affiliate network that offers Pay Per Download, so if someone will download via your affiliate link - you earn money\n4. Upload to that affiliate network a couple of files, like image/png, pdf... and most important give them a real name like Fullname Password front, Bank account statement... and so on... so like to look like a real one\n5. The most important... for your email create a vacation autoreply to all, and here just create a nice message but not like a vacation reply, but to look more real, like replying to a real email... so like thank you, I’m glad I finally won something bla bla... and like in the end attach all the links to the affiliate downloaded files... so like to mention, here are my password front photo... here is my bank statement... so main idea is for the spammer to really think that you believed him and you sent him back real info\n\n...and then just wait for results... I mean you could just forget about these emails... it will work automatically for you\n\nso again, this is just one of my theoretical ideas that I’m not even sure will work at all...\n\nmaybe here someone will want to try or maybe tried something before and wants to share thoughts on this...",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I posted this in another subreddit and I got some heartwarming messages that it inspired them, so I'm going to share this with you, hopefully it can inspire some of you as well. (I don't have anything to sell, don't worry.)\n\nI’ve been doing Amazon KDP (Amazon's self publishing platform) since August of 2024, a little over a year now. It is possible to do it on the side, I didn't because I started with nothing. Literally. No money, living out of my car, and I needed to do something about my situation. I want to share my full experience scaling this from $0 to $150K revenue. The lessons I learned, and why I think KDP is nowhere near saturated as many claim.\n\nMy hope is that this post will give you value, motivation, and perspective, especially if you’re just starting out or feel stuck.\n\n# A Little Background\n\nI’ve always been into business, ever since i was a kid flipping Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh cards and other collectibles, plus video game currencies, items, accounts. Over the years I’ve tried everything: forex, stock trading, affiliate marketing, SEO blogs, dropshipping, customer acquisition/lead generation agency, CPA marketing, SMMA, POD, and of course KDP.\n\nJust to keep in mind, this is not my first time doing KDP. My first attempt was in 2019, but my account got banned in early 2020 for a few (frustrating) reasons:\n\n* I used a term, that a few months later got filled for trademark and Amazon flagged me, even tho the trademark was just pending and was rejected later.\n* Got hit with a “similar cover” strike ( I should have fought it, probably would have won. Not sure why I didn’t.)\n* Published a book called “Snarky Nurse Coloring Book” with the idea that the book was snarky (snarky quotes), not the nurse. Tt got reported by a brand called Snarky Nurse or something similar.\n\nAfter the third strike, Amazon didn’t let me appeal or explain myself, they kept sending the same generic response that the decision is final and nothing could be done.\n\nAfter all this I didn’t do anything, I got comfortable, had plenty in savings, some other life events happened during covid that I lost any motivation to do anything, until life forced me to start again.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nI’m not smart or special. Many people make much more with KDP than I do. But I’ve failed a lot, learned from my mistakes, and treated this like a real business. What I’ll share is what worked for me. Hopefully you’ll learn something useful from it and get some clarity on how you should approach this business if you decide to give it a shot.\n\n# Quick Stats:\n\n* Started: August 2024.\n* Books Published 148. (1 book every 3 days or so)\n* Total Revenue: \\~$150,000\n* Ad Spend: \\~$16,000\n* Employee Costs: \\~$24,000\n* Tools &amp; Subscriptions: \\~$2,500\n* TikTok Marketing Videos: \\~2,000\n* Profit (before tax): \\~100,000\n\nLast month, I made \\~$32,000 revenue, with \\~$10,000 in expenses.\n\n# Lessons, Tests &amp; Observations:\n\n1. **Quality vs. Quantity.** I’ve seen many YouTubers talk about focusing only on quality and to be honest I don’t fully agree. I started with quantity, not because I believed in mass publishing, but because I wanted data. I uploaded many somewhat decent quality books at first (most didn’t even hit 10 sales) and they helped me to identify which niches and formats had potential. Then I moved to more medium quality books, they took me 2-5 days each, in niches that showed potential and these confirmed the winners. I then outsourced even better versions and that’s where most of my revenue came from (excluding the unicorn). So it’s not quality or quantity, you need both to optimize your business.\n2. **Amazon ads.** I’m a numbers guy, I love data, tracking, testing everything. With amazon ads you obviously get more sales, but you also get an 20-30% bump in the organic sales. Sales boost your BSR, help you rank higher, which gets you more sales, more reviews, and all of this combined, a stronger foundation in the algorithm, making it more difficult for competitors to outrank you. So yes, ads are worth it, even beyond direct ROI. There’s another reason why I find ads even more important than getting sales. To be honest I didn’t even start them with the idea to make money from them directly. As I said, I love data, and amazon unfortunately shows you almost no valuable data at all. Running ads helps you a little bit as you can see the impressions you get, how many clicks you get and how many conversions, enough signal to see what’s working and what isn’t. It’s not ideal, but this is what we have to deal with when it comes to amazon.\n3. **Keywords.** Always use relevant keywords, leave fields if you don’t have anything relevant to add. I tested adding trending but not relevant keywords on a couple of books that had \\~20 sales a month each. Sales dropped to 4 and 6 the first month and 1 and 0 on the second month. Removing those irrelevant keywords didn’t restore the sales. Only running ads brought them back. Unrelated words hurt your relevance score, which can tank your book entirely\n4. **External ads.** I had some experimentation with meta ads, spend $600 and made \\~$450 above baseline over the next few months (sales doubled the month with the ads being run and slowly fell back to baseline). Still not enough data to fully judge, I’ll test this more, I need to spend at least $10,000 to have at least some opinion about this, and that’s what I’m going to do in the upcoming months.\n5. **A+ Content.** Almost always helps unless it’s really, really bad. I’ve tested many different layouts, worst ones had \\~10% increase in CVR, the best ones increased 80-150%, depending on the niche and design. Either way, it helps.\n6. **Cover Design (not just artsy, its psychology).** After niche selection, cover is the most important factor. People do judge a book by it’s cover If your design isn’t at least as good as top competitors in that niche, your book is gonna sink in the vast ocean that is Amazon. If you can afford it and your design skills aren’t great, I would suggest outsourcing covers to skilled designers. Still, do some of them yourself, to have a better understanding as not all of it is art, it’s more about the psychology of the customer, it is the pitch for your product. (Also the content of the book has to be good enough as well, because negative reviews can kill your book just as easily as bad cover, just a little slower).\n7. **Descriptions.** I’m not sure if I am just bad at writing them, but I never seen a big difference in CVR from it. The only thing that seems to matter in my experience is the formatting. The description still has to be informative and relevant to the book itself, but if it’s done in a big block of text it’s not gonna help. If it is formatted nicely, then I’ve seen 10-30% CVR improvements. The other thing that I’ve noticed is that having a relevant and informative description helps the book rank higher. It happened consistently enough to make me almost sure that Amazon’s algorithm rewards it.\n8. **Low Search Volume Niches (Small Margins Scale Big).** Pretty much every YouTube video I watched about KDP said to target niches that have high search volume of 1000+ at the minimum and ignore every one of them that get less. I often target niches other skip, even less than 500 searches per month. I care more about competitor strength and actual sales. If I feel I have a fighting chance against the competitor in that kind of niche, that has 100-200k BSR, then I’ll attack it. I get it, making books that are going to get 100-200 sales a month isn’t sexy, but over the year they make $1,200-$2,400, and ten, twenty, thirty, one hundred of these adds up to real income.\n9. **E-mail Lists.** These are great but I’ve only managed to make them work in two situations. In my unicorn niche, I built a list of 1,000+ via a variety of freebies. When I launched a supporting book with a release day discount, I emailed the list and got 200+ day one sales. I’m not saying that 20% of the email list converted, but even if 3-4% can create enough sales velocity to push the book up the rankings making it get even more sales and climb even higher up. Second, with my “client” brand (consumable books). We built the list by running promotional ads and in book freebies. After every weekly release, the email goes out and almost consistently gets 100 day one sales, some releases even get 200-300.\n10. **Short-Form Video Marketing.** One day I got bored and thought about trying out something new, I released a book in a very competitive niche(which means lot’s of interested people) and created a TikTok account to make videos for that book. After printing the book and recording a few videos, repurposing them, following trends, changing the hooks , etc., one video hit nearly 1m views. This led to over 2,000 sales in the first week after upload. Since then I’ve uploaded 250+ videos, hired other people to make videos for me and I’ve had a few other viral videos (not as bit as the original one tho).\n11. **Pricing.** Compete on the quality of your book rather than price, if your book is better than competitor’s, price it higher and position it as premium. Low price makes you look cheap, not “affordable”. The pricing is different depending on the niche and type of the book itself, so what I would recommend is to launch around the average competitor price, could be a little higher if you are confident in your book (that’s what I do), or price it just a little below the average. Monitor CVR, if it is solid, then increase the price by $1 and observe, if it gets too big of a hit, reverse the change if it doesn’t keep increasing the price. If the book ranks high, gets steady organic sales and reviews, push premium pricing.\n12. **99% of Gamblers Give Up Before They Hit it Big.** Okay, maybe not in gambling (please don’t). But in business? Mostly true. Most people give up right before they’ve learned enough both from theirs, and other people’s failures to make their business work. There’s plenty of money in almost every business. Imagine a gambler spinning the slots, after 30 failed spins, he hits jackpot. Business it’s similar, keep testing, keep learning, fail, tweak it, try again. Do that 30 times and on attempt 31 it suddenly looks like you “got lucky”(You didn’t. You just didn’t quit.) If you knew that you were 30 failures away from your dream, would you keep going?\n13. AI Tools as Assistants, Not Crutches Do not let AI do all the work for you. You won’t really learn what’s working and the quality will be subpar. People notice that the book was written by AI and leave negative reviews. Use it to brainstorm ideas, rough outlines, keyword ideas that you’re gonna validate, even sketch A+ layouts. Always double check the accuracy (AI likes to hallucinate) and IP. AI speeds you up, significantly, but it doesn’t do the job for you.\n14. **KDP plateau.** Plateaus do happen at every stage. I sat at a bit over $6,000 per month for a while, luckily for me it was a decent enough revenue to stay motivated. Some people, especially beginners, plateau at $0 per month, or they reach $500 in the first months, stall for a few months, assume “KDP is dead” and quit. It’s not. It’s just lag and learning. The move isn’t to quit, it’s to keep publishing and keep making small improvements. Eventually you’ll break out. Keep going, keep measuring, keep improving and then the compounding finally shows up.\n15. **Outsourcing and delegating.** All of this is going to depend on your budget and skill level. I hire people to go faster, not to disappear. I keep strategy, ads, research, final approval and hand off stuff like covers, interiors, basic edits, videos. I also do some books fully myself to keep improving and learning. At first you should do everything yourself, to learn as much as possible, to even know what to ask your employees to do, to be able to make SOPs for them. Eventually when you can no longer keep up with the amount of books you want to make, you start hiring. Track cost per title, have an idea on how fast the contractors work, how long it is going to take to make a book. Keep light P M Cadence, do weekly check-ins, have a QC checklist before anything goes live. Plan so that one person’s vacation doesn’t stall launches. Pay on time, give bonuses when earned, give specific feedback, promote your A-players.\n16. **Treat it like a real business and I mean REAL business.** KDP isn’t a lottery ticket, it’s a real publishing business. I budget, track unit economics and make decisions off numbers, not vibes. That means knowing your CTR/CVR, ACOS/TACOS, margin, payback time (how long till the book repays it’s investment), opportunity cost, LTV per title and more. Keep a simple P&amp;L, reinvest into ads, books, testing, learning. Write SOPs for contractors, kill or fix anything that doesn’t earn its shelf space. Manage your cashflow, plan for seasonality, keep runway for tests, don’t starve the winners. Be boringly safe on ToS/IP and make sure to set aside money for taxes. Real business = clear goals, clean and tight processes, consistent iteration.\n17. **You need action much more than you need information.** Most people don’t have a knowledge problem, they have a doing problem. You can binge every KDP video, read every post in KDP forums and still have $0 in royalties because you never uploaded anything. On top of that you’re gonna forget most of the stuff you watched either way if you do not try to implement it almost immediately. When and if you’ll start taking action, you’ll go back and start rewatching those videos again with context. Learn just enough to take action. By taking action you’ll learn the most. Half baked action beats perfect research because market teaches faster than any tutorial. Most importantly be consistent with your action, and consistently improve with it.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\nKDP is not oversaturated. People said that it was already “too late” back in 2019 when I first started, and they’ll say the same in 2030. The real difference is how you treat KDP. Treat it like a real business. Track data. Build Systems. Reinvest Profits. TEST RELENTLESSLY. Be consistent and improve every week. Stagnation is death, and even to maintain your level, you have to keep evolving because the competition is evolving. Plan your week. Every Sunday, I write down my tasks and deadlines. And I need to do them. No excuses. That habit alone kept me on track for 60-70 hours a week for over a year.\n\n# My Goals for the Future\n\nThis December my plan is to get to $100,000 - the coveted six figure month. I know it’s possible, because December sales can triple or quadruple.  \nBut my goals don’t stop here.\n\n**My next milestone for 2026:**  \n$1,000,000 in total revenue  \n$253k+ in December 2026 alone.  \nThe reason for that specific figure is that back in 2020 I spoke with someone who made $252K in December 2019 with a team consisting of her and her husband. I’m going to have a bigger team than that to try to hit this number, but let’s ignore that fact.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis year has been life-changing. I went from being broke and sleeping in my car to running a six figure publishing business. I don’t think that this was luck. It was consistency, constant improvement, and treating KDP like the serious business it is. If you’re reading this and were thinking about quitting. DON’T. Keep going, test things, learn from your data, stay disciplined. Do not think “What if it’s not going work out? What if I fail?”. Think “What if everything does work out?”.",

With a very small budget, it feels almost impossible to succeed in this business. You mentioned you were broke before, so I’m curious how did you manage your budget in the beginning?",

      "selftext": "Most SaaS founders treat content as afterthought. I made SEO core from day one with FounderToolkit. Started 18 months ago with zero audience, now at $7K MRR with 60% of signups from organic search. The playbook: Months 1-2, I targeted bottom-funnel buyer-intent keywords comparison posts like \"[Competitor] alternative,\" \"Best [category] for [specific use case],\" tactical how-to tutorials. Search volume 10-50 monthly, low competition, high conversion rates. Published 8 posts month one, 12 posts month two, all 1,200-1,800 words focused on specific problems.\n\nMonths 3-4, I wrote long-tail problem posts from validation interviews \"How to validate SaaS idea without building,\" \"Cheapest way to launch SaaS product.\" These ranked fast (2-3 months) because keyword competition was minimal. Conversion rate 8-12% because search intent matched perfectly. Months 5-6, I published case study content turned founder interviews into posts like \"[Founder name]: $0 to $10K in 6 months.\" These got shared naturally, built backlinks organically, provided social proof simultaneously.\n\nThe system: published 2-3 posts weekly with zero skipping, internal linking between related posts, natural product mentions without forced CTAs. Results timeline: months 1-3 had zero traffic, month 4 hit 200 visitors, month 6 reached 1,200 visitors, month 12 at 8,000 visitors, month 18 at 25,000 visitors. SEO now drives 15-20 signups daily without spending on ads. Complete strategy with keyword research frameworks in [Toolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org).",

I went down a pretty big rabbit hole reading Reddit threads, founders’ stories, complaints, success posts, everything I could find. The same pain points kept popping up over and over—on both sides.\n\nFrom the **merchant side**, I kept seeing things like:  \n• “Hard to know which affiliates actually drive incremental revenue.”  \n• “Coupon sites vacuum up commissions on sales we would’ve gotten anyway.”  \n• “Tracking breaks constantly or needs tons of dev work.”  \n• “Refunds and cancellations are a nightmare to reconcile.”  \n• “Fraud and low-quality affiliates make the whole thing feel sketchy.”\n\nFrom the **affiliate side**, it was stuff like:  \n• “Opaque tracking… feels like I’m guessing half the time.”  \n• “Platforms don’t keep creators updated on deals or new offers.”  \n• “Most tools are made for big creators, not smaller ones.”  \n• “Delayed payouts or unclear earnings.”  \n• “Zero support… just drive traffic and hope for the best.”\n\nAfter reading all this, I started wondering:  \n**What would a super simple, drop-in affiliate system look like if it was built in 2025 from scratch?**\n\nSomething like:\n\n* One script added to the site\n* Auto-tracking of clicks + purchases\n* Clear attribution\n* Dead simple dashboard\n* AI-powered fraud detection and refund reconciliation\n* Tools that help creators actually convert, not just blast links\n\nNo huge setup, no custom backend, no clunky legacy stuff.\n\nRight now, I’ve only built a small landing page and waitlist form just to see if there’s real interest before I invest months into this. Absolutely nothing is live and I have no product to sell. Just trying to validate the idea.\n\n**Here’s the prototype landing page if anyone wants to take a look or join the waitlist:**  \n[https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/](https://affiliate-platform-e0416.web.app/)\n\n(I only include this because some subs require you to show what you’re working on. If the link isn’t allowed, mods can remove it, no hard feelings.)\n\nMy actual question for this sub:  \n**If you’re a merchant, creator, or anyone who deals with affiliate programs, would a drop-in system like this actually solve anything for you?**  \nOr are the real problems somewhere else entirely?\n\nHappy to take criticism, suggestions, or “dude don’t build this” feedback too. The whole point is figuring out if this is useful before writing real code.",

Because an employee in Lebanon is either working for a wealthy family, or the government. And so people just assume he or she ‘serves’. (Of course; judges and generals are highly respected.) \n\nAnd how about employment in Eastern Europe? There it is shameful not to work. And people don’t understand the idea of being an independent businessman. I own cash flowing assets in Eastern Europe and I build to sell in Lebanon. So I think I’m doing fine. And yet, people in Eastern Europe still think that I am an unemployed person who doesn’t contribute to their economy 😂 \n\nAnyway, I agree with you.

So I quit one job, took an amount of risk that was semi crazy due to being married with 6 kids. Wife was a stay at home mom.  It was rough, 2 repos, less than fine dining etc. Financial strain more than you can imagine, but I didn't quit, no matter how many times I wanted to. 5 years later I worked my way up to almost a 200k a year income. To this day my kids favorite meals are egg and rice and pepperoni sandwhiches eventhough steak is an option. To this day I still work the other full time job.

There is no such thing as a person that can't deal with uncertainty, managing money or that needs constant validation - there just are people that can't do that stuff RIGHT NOW, because that's where they are, who they believe they are and who they choose to be in the future.\n\nThe key is personal growth. It sounds cliche because so many wannabe coaches preach it, but it is true. Just imagine who you were as a child. There is very little of that person in you right now. You changed. The only difference is that most of those changes happen by accident, while the most necessary changes must happen by choice.\n\nOnce you decide to change, you have to act. If you want to learn how to deal with uncertainty, well, put yourself in risky situations. Put your money in small caps, buy cripto, start a side hustle. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you want to learn how to manage money, well, save and try to manage money. Buy courses, read books on the subject. Assess where you fuck up and learn. If you crave external validation, go to therapy and put yourself in situations in which people doubt you. Assess where you fuck up and learn. Every failure in your journey will hurt - some of them will hurt a lot. Assess the pain, learn and move on.\n\nWhere people go wrong is that they listen to their ego and unsuccessful people, let fear take over their decision rationale, fail to take ownership and responsibility and develop a flawed thought process in which they try as hard as possible to seek comfort and avoid pain. That leads to stagnation, frustration and resentment.\n\nGrowth is in failure and pain. Success is what you attain after you become the person who withstood and rose above those challenges.\n\nIn case you are wondering, this isn't some coaching bullshit. I became a much bettern partner after my first wife divorced me, I went to therapy and owned my shit. I became a better professional after 10 years of service in a company that pushed me as far as I could go. I learned how to build a business after blowing up a failed venture and going bankrupt. It all hurt like fucking hell at the time. I went through depression, substance abuse and all that jazz. I had to decide to get better. Things only got better once I put myself in the driver seat of my own life. If I did it, anyone can. I'm just a random dude from a midsized city in a third world country. ",

The point I'm getting at here is, the vast majority of businesses in America are what I call \"micro\" companies. Companies that are anywhere from 5-15+ employees.\n\nSo why is it like this? The reason is very simple. Every  business, is a bunch of micro business that you could do easier and easier. **No matter what skill you have, that you use at a company, is being used as a stand alone company somewhere else.** \n\nWhat do I mean by this? Fine, you have this horrible job at a car dealership. You are a receptionist. You hate it. You want something else. \n\n**Ever heard of Concentrix? They recently did 10 BILLION in revenue by answering phones.** You know there are people, working at companies now, answering phones for less than $15 an hour. \n\nCar dealerships, clean cars, fix cars, sell cars, sell parts. ALL things you can hire people to do for you. My friends company does very well with just a window tint/detail company. Is **he going to be the next Microsoft? Probably not. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.** You just need to make enough money that you never have to stress about money again. \n\nEntrepreneurship is not brutal. I've never struggled because I planned and followed rules. If you don't have basic money skills, learn! The largest issue I see is people try to start too big. With too big of a vision. Lets vacuum some floors first. Lets clean some windows. Lets cut some grass. Your neighbor always complaining about how dirty the dog is? My friend Sara makes MONEY with her pet grooming company. \n\n**Most of all:**\n\nQuit telling people its hard.\n\nQuit telling people its stressful.\n\nQuit telling people they shouldn't.\n\nQuit telling people they can't do it because YOU couldn't do it. \n\nI HOPE someone on here looks at your post and says F that shit.

          "body": "Okay. Long rant ahead.\n\nReal wealth is discretionary time. I’ve run my own solo consulting practice for 15 years and here’s the truth most people don’t want to admit.\n\nMost folks hand over their entire life for a paycheck they don’t even like. They stay in jobs that drain them. They stay in marriages that have been dead, sexless, miserable for years - or for the “sake of the children.” One day they’ll  leave once the kids are grown up. They call it “security” while trading away the only thing they can’t earn back.\n\nAnd the punchline is cruel. By the time they finally “can” live, they’ve forgotten how. By the time, its time to retire, 60-70% of your life is OVER. It's the third quarter and you’re exhausted.\n\nWorking for yourself isn’t magic. It’s ownership. Your own wins. Your own screwups. Your own failures. Your life. Most people aren’t trapped by their job. They’re trapped by their tolerance for misery.\n\nFreedom isn’t given. You take it. You build it. You protect it.\n\nThe real failure isn’t the bad job or the clueless boss. **It’s thinking too small**. People dream in inches then wonder why their life feels tight. You don’t escape the rat race by getting a laptop. You escape it by raising your expectations for your own life. You set standards for yourself beyond what anything thinks is normal or rational.\n\nAnd here’s the part nobody teaches. Most people who leave corporate end up with a worse boss. The boss is *you*. And you’re brutal. You don’t trust yourself. You overthink. You worry about being judged. You micromanage your own ambition into dust. You make lousy money.\n\nPeople want to *play* entrepreneur, not *be* one. They want the aesthetic. Not the accountability. Real entrepreneurship is boring, lonely, and occasionally humiliating. It’s also the only path where your life becomes yours.\n\nMost people don’t fail because they lack talent. They fail because they never commit to being the one on the hook.\n\nAnd **finally**. My personal belief. There has NEVER been an easier time in history to earn six figures, even multi six figures, on your own. There may NEVER be a moment like this, ever again. The opportunities are everywhere. The tools are cheap. The playing field is wide open. The barrier to entry is ZERO.\n\nMost people still won’t do it. Not because it’s impossible. But because they don’t believe in themselves enough to try - and they set goals WAY TOO SMALL!",

Getting told what to do by people who didn't even understand the problem, watching politics beat competence... it drains you in a way sleep can't fix.\n\nWhat changed my life was when I realized I wanted my energy to go somewhere that actually mattered to me. Building something of your own forces you to face fear, uncertainty, and responsibility but it also gives you back your self respect. You start waking up thinking, at least the pain you feel today is mine, not caused by someon else's ego.\n\nSo I sold my big houses, my Porsches to run my own mental health startup, It was not easy, it was so painful, I just launched it 6 months ago and start seeing customers subscribing to the app and I am trying to scale it to 10k. The cost of doing this was big, I lost friends, my money, my health, my friends but...I am doing what is meaningful by helping others with their mental health.",

Salir de esa rueda no pasa de un día para otro, pero sí se puede.  \nEn mi caso, empecé buscando alternativas online mientras aún estaba en mi trabajo. Probé varios métodos, y con el tiempo encontré una herramienta que me permitió generar ingresos estables por mi cuenta sin depender de jefes ni horarios.  \nNo es magia, pero cuando empezás a ver que podés sostenerte solo, cambia por completo tu mentalidad: pasás de “aguantar el trabajo” a “elegir dónde poner tu energía”.

Initially, I did feel exhilarated and like I was tasting the freedom that I think you're longing for. But it didn't take long for me to realize that I was ignorant about a lot of things and deluding myself into thinking that I had all the answers. I was the clueless one.\n\nMy life is great now, but there were several points along the way where I found myself wondering what life would have been like if a more humble me in the past would have asked different questions and looked more skeptically at the grass on both sides of the fence before jumping. Personally, I also needed a lot more therapy and maturity. Starting my own company nearly cost me my marriage and even my life.\n\nI hope you find the next step in your journey soon and that it's a peaceful transition. I don't think that it should have to be an either/or situation, Corporate vs freelance/small business owner. I think you can work in corporate America and still be happy. I also know from other entrepreneurs' stories that you can do your own thing and be utterly miserable. It might be time for you to make the leap, but I'd recommend honing your side hustle skills first and checking out what other opportunities are out there.",

I’m sure you have skills and expertise that people are willing to pay for or you wouldn’t have a job. Take one of those skills, create an avatar of people that would buy your service/expertise. Find 10 of those people, if they don’t buy what you’re selling move to the next skill until people start paying for it. Then you hire people that can do it for you. Then you find 1 person to manage those people. Make enough money to pay people a decent wage every 2 weeks, pay bills and if you are able to do that it’s just rinse and repeat.

The people making real money aren't worried about saturation because they're focused on execution, not excuses.\n\n\n\nStart with something you can begin this week, not next month. Pick ONE thing from your list (I'd personally go with running ads since it's skill-based and businesses always need it) and commit to landing your first client within 30 days. Don't worry about scaling to 10k yet, worry about proving you can deliver results for one person. Most people never make it past the first client because they're too busy planning their empire instead of doing the boring work of getting good at something.\n\n\n\nThe corporate ladder isn't going anywhere if you need to fall back on it, but you'll never know what you're capable of if you keep researching instead of executing.

You’re just early enough to be seeing the highlight reels of people who’ve been grinding for years and mistaking that for everyone’s doing it but me. Trust me, most of those 10k/month people you see online either, already had skills, already had money, or they conveniently don’t show you the 18 months they made nothing.\n\nabout the everything feels saturated thing, you’re not wrong. A lot of these spaces are saturated because people jump in blindly, copy whatever a guru says, and expect money to fall out of the sky. That’s why most fail.\n\nI’ll tell you what I tell anyone I’ve worked with, online income isn’t hard because the business models are bad. It’s hard because people underestimate the skill part. You mentioned ads which is a perfect example. Ads used to be a cheat code. If you run ads before building trust, you’re basically burning money. People don’t buy because they saw your ad. They buy because they trust the person behind the ad.\n\nI’ve seen people throw 500- 2k into ads with zero return because the foundation wasn’t there. Same with ecom, with digital products and with high ticket offers.\n\nEvery single model requires, knowing how to build a brand, knowing how to market without being annoying, learning how to create demand, learning how to communicate value, consistency and actual patience\n\nNobody wants to talk about those parts because they’re not lavish\n\nAnd yes, start while you’re still working. Anyone telling you to quit your job and go all in is setting you up to panicbuild instead of grow. Your job buys you time, reduces pressure, and lets you actually learn instead of chasing quick wins.\n\nIf I were starting at 20 again, I’d pick one model that actually aligns with my strengths, get the right education around it (whether through paid programs or months of deep research), and treat the first 6 months as skill building not income chasing. Real money comes once you stop trying to get rich fast and actually learn how the machine works.\n\nIf you want to talk specifics or narrow down what fits you, I don’t mind helping, been in the space a while and I’ve seen what actually works versus what just looks good on social media",

I think that’s what I struggled with the most and I want to get everything done today or when I get off from work and it just can’t get done especially if you also prioritize going to the gym and have a day for cleaning and meal prepping. But what I can say starting was probably the second hardest thing and laying down the foundations. But like many in the sub and everywhere you will read and watch business is about testing and speed. If you get an idea just take action and test if it works and makes you some money. Yeah you have to give it time to see if it works but the steps for every model for the online space are almost the same. Not to be general and cliche the steps are get an idea, build a website or mvp with a waiting list or form, market your idea either social media organic or running ads to that website, and track absolutely everything. Scrolls, clicks, all the data you can gather collect it because later it will be useful. But yeah that’s the jist of things. I’m way farther than I was when I started and I got there by first doing one task a day and that turned into 3 tasks that o do daily. And then it just becomes autonomous",

At 20 you're actually in the best position because you can afford to fail fast and cheap. Pick literally anything from your list - ads, automation, whatever - and commit to testing it for 90 days with a small budget. Most people making real money aren't doing anything revolutionary, they're just consistent and they actually started instead of endlessly researching.

We always focus on optimistic, best-case scenarios, ignoring risks and historical data. \n\nThat said, I think this capacity to underestimate things can be a huge advantage.\n\nIn fact, I believe that for a founder to be successful, they need to be delusional to a large degree:\n\n\\- They are up against huge odds\n\n\\- Everyone around them is telling them that they are wasting their time.\n\n\\- They might be even introducing a new product that customers don't get yet.\n\nHowever, what really matters is what happens when that rosy picture collides with harsh reality. The founders who persevere and show grit tend to be ones that make it. But for every founder that plowed on, you have several others who gave up the instant their idealistic image was shattered.",

If this is the cause, it would at least explain some of the challenges you've experienced and give you an idea on how to treat (medicate) the condition.\n\nIf you don't have ADHD, your inability to complete tasks and move ideas forward could mean that you need a system for organizing/completing tasks that works for you.",

It opens your mind the the most important aspect of business which is get a customer and get them to pay. Nothing else matters if you have 0 sales. Once you witness the full process of sales it expands how you think about business systems. 2. Start something incredibly simple to get a grasp of all the functions. Sales , marketing, operations, finance, opening an LLC, accounting and tax. You get a taste of how all this stuff works. You can do it on the weekend. Like junk removal or auto detailing. Simple businesses you can start with $1000 or less to get experience. Then jump into a high leverage opportunity once you have clarity from action. Clarity comes from action not thinking or watching youtube videos. In my opinion the perfect simple service business for you to start would be test prep or tutoring. Lets say you were really good at preparing for test prep. Go tape 50 signs around campus saying, \"Test prep $40 off and guaranteed 20% improvement on test scores with 4 session minimum\".

Customer support basically said \"yeah that happens.\" I was paying $1,250/month for a 50% accuracy rate. Insane.\n\nSo in February I got fed up and spent a weekend learning Python. Built a scraper that:\n- Finds .de domains in my target niches\n- Extracts emails from their contact pages (Impressum in Germany - legally required contact info)\n- Validates them before I even send an email\n\nRan it last month on ~2,500 dental practice websites:\n- Got 4,800+ emails \n- Bounce rate when I sent: 4.7% (vs the 50% I was getting before)\n- Cost: $43 in API fees + $12 AWS hosting\n\nI'm not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share because if you're paying for lead databases and getting garbage results like I was, you might want to look into building your own.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the technical side.\n",

First, create a one form onboarding and one offboarding workflow that triggers procurement, IT provisioning, and an asset record being created or retired. Second, centralize a simple asset table with fields for owner, status, serial, issue date, and return date, and automate a nightly digest that flags missing or overdue devices. For tooling a lot of teams stitch together a ticketing tool like Jira Service Management or Zendesk with an inventory table in Airtable or a DB, and then use whatever BI layer your team already uses to run weekly audits. If you want non-technical managers to ask “who has the MacBook from April” without bothering IT, a natural language query layer can help; some folks use Metabase, Airtable plus reporting, or newer NL-to-SQL layers like Astrasql so people can get answers without learning SQL.",

      "selftext": "So I had, or should I say, had a client who used to be a pretty nice guy, or at least I thought so until recently when he messaged me saying I was tampering with his business and how he can't think of any other reason his roofing company is now failing other than it being my fault and how I should expect a lawsuit or to hear from his lawyer in the near future.\n\nI haven't said anything back to him despite having a pre-F\\*\\*\\* off message in my drafts, but to give you some context, it wasn't always like this. I met him through FB when he messaged me after I posted some Google Business Results from another client of mine, and after some talking back and forth, he agreed he wanted to give it a go. Things were great, rankings were moving, client was very responsive. Essentially, everything I could ask for until eventually he decided to go against my word in favor of a buddy he knows. Whatever right it's his business, but this eventually became a constant theme and would leak over into our work. Before you know it, these \"Suggestions\" his buddy was making would move our rankings from number 2 in the map pack generating 50-60 calls a month down into the top 5 where calls were still good but nowhere near the same, and you could feel there was no bottom/end to this until eventually he fired me when I refused some of the vital changes he wanted.\n\nI didn't take it to heart, aside from the friend stuff he was a good guy so we parted ways but I guess things continued to drop in ranking once I left. Now fast forward to a few months out and I guess he's convinced himself that I'm doing voodoo black hat magic against his business. Like I said interesting scenario but I can asssure you I'm not tampering or doing anything and it actually pisses me off a little that he would assume that, considering my only goal in the first place was to help him out and I even gave that little rat a discount when he first signed. I'm a little heated but what do you think the best way to tell him to F\\*\\*\\* off is without escalating this any further?",

I have no way out of this contract\". Which is false, there is a convenience clause he could've ended with 60 day notice.

Cease all informal contact.\n* **Demand Absolute Specificity:** Require a comprehensive and formal submission detailing their claims, including:\n   * A detailed, itemized list of all alleged grievances.\n   * A precise monetary value assigned to each alleged damage, supported by a thorough justification of how that value was calculated.\n   * A complete list of any and all potential witnesses, including their full contact information.\n   * Certified copies of any and all documentation they believe substantiates their claim.\n\n**The Strategy:** The endless requests for documentation and strict adherence to arbitrary procedures are designed to exhaust their energy and motivation. This isn't about winning an argument; it's about making the process so arduous that they give up.\n\n**Your Demeanor:** Your calm, composed, and detached tone is your greatest asset. It subconsciously de-escalates the situation. By refusing to engage in an emotional exchange, you control the entire dynamic of the interaction.\n\n**Advanced Tactics:** Invent your own internal \"policies\" for handling such disputes. For example: \"It is the policy of this respondent to require all financial claims to be substantiated by no fewer than two independent, certified appraisals.\"\n\nYou can also quote long, fabricated policy statements in your responses to further bog them down in procedural quicksand.

Start with how that content is edited and shot. There are slight differences between each platform, and bearing those differences in mind can help buoy your content.\n\n\\- Considering using ads.

I make 5 digits monthly from the two gigs and Im scaling them up to this day. The problem is the process for getting it registered is so quiet complicated. \n\nIts basically under the table and i have no proof of income coming from it. Cause I sell products in fb marketplace or through friends and network. I have coding background aswell. And i want to try something new. Got fired yesterday but im going to be celebrating tonight for reaching $500k earnings from my gigs. Im the only one who knows this and i just want to share it with strangers here in reddit.\n\nI cant share it with family or friends cause I feel like its wrong, its going to change my life and attitude for the worse because of pressure of trying to maintain my successful image , but at the same time i want to share my success or to brag maybe? Reddit became kind off my therapy and therapist.\n\nToday is a good day. I enjoyed the ferry ride and the scenery. Im gonna be trading some motherboards for PSUs and SSDs and once i come back home, im gonna say sorry to my wife and come clean. Have a good day fellas! \n\n",

Remember the noise you hear will never be about the failures. For every win you see, there are 10,000 failures. Be positive you want it before you start.\n\n2. If you don’t know what kind of business you want to start with the 50k, I revisit my point above. You need to want it so bad to push through the “I can’t pay my bills next month” times that will inevitably come. In order to do that, you need to either love what you’re pursuing or at least thoroughly enjoy it enough to push through the hard. Cause there will be a lot of it. \n\n3. If you have 50k, 2-3k should be used to actually start the business + sheer hustle. The remaining 47k should be used to get you through making jack shit or being u profitable for X amount of time. Don’t overshoot too early, you likely won’t need half of the shit you’ll invest in before you actually get started. \n\n4. Most importantly, if you’re getting into business because you don’t want to work for someone else - be VERY careful about the business you choose, the way you set it up and how much overhead you take on. Cause what you’ll see happen without even noticing it happening is becoming an employee to your own business. Remember to OWN your business, don’t let it own you. \n\nHope this all helps!

Or are startups better off with purely technical teams in the early stages?\n\nI’m tech-savvy and not afraid to learn to code if it’s essential, but I’m unsure whether that’s the best use of my time if I eventually find a strong technical partner.

          "body": "Here's my take. I used to run a construction business but taught myself how to build software. I developed my own crm, some marketing software, built the website and self hosted everything off a server in my apartment. On the plus side my office overhead was like $20/month for all the software we used because I built it.\n\nI tossed around the idea of starting a software company but I'm hesitent. Here's my take:\n\n1. As a non technical founder, you don't have the depth of knowledge to understand if a specific software stack is actually profitable. Most \"tech bros\" actually jam together a bunch of services and put their logo on it and call it \"their software\" when in reality they are paying 6 other companies for access to THEIR software. Basically you \"own the brand\" but not the actual software.\n2. Profitability is in the stack and not necessarily what the software does. For example, my website + lead gen software cost me $3/month. If you use wix, or another website builder, you'd pay $25-$50/month for the same service I get for $3 because I built it myself. So, if you don't create a \"software moat\" it's likely you'll end up using multiple other vendors to build your \"stack\" and end up bleeding all the upside in monthly API fees. If you build an AI automated CRM (for example) but you plug into AWS and GPT for api calls and hosting, you'll rack up $1000s/month in \"fees\". If you host the CRM yourself and train a small AI model, you're overhead would be near 0.\n3. The market is flooded and I mean FLOODED, with software. Unless you are excelent at sales and marketing, you'll struggle to provide any real value that other, larger companies don't. And, software behavior is very entrenched, people don't switch tools if ever. For example, a CRM, getting a company to switch from Microsoft to my CRM would be a nightmare and then try integrating it with their other workflows...just a huge hassle.\n\nAnyway, I'm not saying you can't do it. But from my perspective unless the software is self contained and built and the \"moat\" is in the stack - ie, cheap to actually scale, it's not an easy business to get into. Alot of the software bros you'll see either developed some niche tool that happens to solve some deep industry specific issue, OR were given a bunch of money and are living on hype and debt.\n\nTLDR \n\n  \nSo, is it worth it? Idk maybe lol. You don't need to be technical to sell something, but being technical helps because you can cut costs.",

This post resonates because nobody tells you that entrepreneurship doesn't just test your business skills - it strips you down to your raw humanity.\n\nWhen our biggest client canceled a $400K order overnight in 2022, I didn't just lose revenue. I lost my ability to pay 59 workers who depended on me. I spent three nights sleeping on the factory floor because I was too ashamed to face my family. The 'boss' everyone saw during daytime video calls was a shell - inside, I was a 39-year-old man who hadn't eaten properly in weeks, wondering if I should just close the doors and get a real job.\n\nHere's what entrepreneurship actually is: it's looking your seamstress in the eyes when you can't pay her on time and explaining why. It's hand-delivering finished goods on your motorcycle at 2AM because the shipping company failed you. It's learning that your 'passion for fashion' means nothing when a client demands you redo 500 dresses three days before Christmas.\n\nI thought being an entrepreneur meant creative freedom. What it actually means is becoming the human safety net for everyone else's problems. The workers who need salaries, the clients who need deadlines met, the suppliers who need payments. Your personal anxiety becomes a luxury you can't afford.\n\nBut here's the unexpected gift: that confrontation forged me into someone I never knew I could be. Two years later, we survived. We now work with 15 international brands, and I've learned to build systems that protect both my team and my sanity. I take Sundays completely off - no emails, no calls - because I finally understand that sustainable businesses are built by sustainable humans.\n\nThe freedom isn't in being your own boss. The real freedom is knowing your breaking point and having the courage to build guardrails before you reach it. To everyone considering entrepreneurship: ask yourself not 'What's my business plan?' but 'Who will I become when everything falls apart?' That's the question nobody prepares you for.",

But every rarely do I actually see numbers or metrics. Its often all emotions and biased.\n\n  \nSo for the ones who have actually measured with some kind of metrics- be it time, or money or something else, what is one task/job AI has measurably made cheaper or better for you? If so, by how much? Provide the metrics if possible :)",

Sharing the numbers below!\n\n* **AI has doubled engineering output:** We have been consistently measuring developer output through PRs merged per developer per week  and cycle/lead time, and our data clearly says on avg, our throughput has literally doubled since started paying for either Windsurf or Cursor for all our developers. Everyone one of them uses one of these to write code now. Personally I love the Windsurf Cascade Agent.\n* **AI has made marketing cheaper significantly:** We were paying an agency like $5k per month to do SEO audits regularly and regularly post blog content on our website to improve search rankings. We were able to completely eliminate the agency and automate the whole process all the way upto posting it on our website using AI tools like Frizerly that has full context about our business, customers, Google analytics and what not!\n* **AI has reduced support resolution time by half:** So we always used Intercom and only had 1 dedicated support person! With Intercom Fin, we have been able to auto resolve questions that were already answered before or often already answered on our FAQs. Other questions are routed to the support person as usual. But since it's half the volume now, support can resolve other questions much faster. Avg resolution time went down from 23 hours to 11 hours!\n\nI can see companies being able to move like a 1000 employee company with just 10-15 in the next 10 years :)",

          "body": "For us, the biggest measurable impact has been in order tracking and customer communication. We had someone spending 5+ hours daily just updating customers on shipment status, answering \"where's my order\" questions, and handling the back-and-forth. Built an n8n workflow that monitors shipments, sends proactive updates, and handles most common inquiries automatically. Time saved is roughly 25 hours per week, which let that person shift to higher-value work like improving the actual customer experience rather than just reporting on it.\n\nSecond one is lead qualification. We were paying $200/month for a lead gen service that still required hours of manual cleanup and research. Replaced it with an automated workflow that scrapes, enriches, and scores leads based on our criteria. Cost dropped to about $10/month in API costs, and the quality actually improved because the criteria are consistent now instead of dependent on whoever's doing the research that day.\n\nThe pattern we've noticed across different implementations is that AI works best when you're replacing repetitive cognitive work, not when you're trying to replace strategic thinking. The wins come from automating the stuff that burns time but doesn't require judgment.",

          "body": "I used to be the exact same way, cycling through project after project like it was my full-time job.\n\n\n\nWhat finally broke the cycle for me was realizing that my brain literally needed different systems than neurotypical entrepreneurs. First thing I did was throw out flexible schedules completely and built what I call \"decision-free days\" where I plan everything the night before and just follow the script. I use Sunsama to timebox every single task on my calendar so there's zero room for my brain to wander or overthink. For the motivation piece, I had to manufacture quick wins by breaking everything down into stupidly small tasks. Like instead of \"build landing page\" it became \"write headline, pick color scheme, add one section\" etc. I track everything obsessively in a daily scorecard because seeing those checkmarks gives me the dopamine hit I need to keep going. The momentum thing was huge for me too, so I created what I call \"restart rituals\" for when I inevitably fall off. Instead of trying to jump back into where I left off (which felt overwhelming), I'd do one tiny 15-minute task related to the project just to rebuild the connection. For delayed gratification I literally gamified everything with point systems and weekly rewards, sounds childish but it works. The paralysis thing still happens but I've learned to just start with the absolute smallest possible step, even if it's just opening the right browser tab. Sometimes that's all it takes to break through the freeze.\n\n\n\nThe key insight for me was accepting that my brain works differently and building systems around that instead of fighting it. Structure isn't a limitation, it's actually what gives you freedom to execute consistently. Once you have the right framework, you can channel that hyperfocus energy way more effectively.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

You deserve all the tools you can access, and no amount of coping strategies will nullify it. And work *with* your neurodivergent brain rather than against it.\n\nPeople with ADHD need constant novelty. We are low baseline dopamine/stimulation and have to constantly feed it. So know in advance that an exciting idea today that becomes a solved problem in a few years will not stick well, because you'll get bored and something else will catch your attention. You need to pick work that will keep giving you new puzzles, new concepts to learn.\n\nFor example, I coach business founders across many industries. Being industry-agnostic forces me to learn new things all the time and keeps the work stimulating. Too much repetition and the work gets too easy. When work is too easy for me, I get bored and want to start something new. Your brain probably grasps concepts and makes intuitive connections quickly. You're probably creative. So put yourself in a position that financially rewards intuitiveness and creativity.\n\nPick the right roles for your brain. Partner with people who complement you, like opposite strengths and weaknesses (and value alignment of course). Detail-oriented people who like creating structure. You can balance each other out - you give them fresh perspectives and inspire them with your creativity and passion for learning. Be cautious teaming up with other ADHDers lol, it can be like trying to walk 8 dogs at once and every dog wants to sniff a different patch of grass.\n\nSo find a purpose that can keep generating fresh challenges for you.

Carve out what you have to do for the next two weeks and break it down into steps. Don't allow yourself more than 3 big goals for the day. (I do this on paper and plan ahead so I'm not overthinking the next steps). If I'm not sure of all the steps, I take the first step for a set period of time. I recap at the end of the session what I've completed and what needs to come next. \"I did x,y,z. Now I need to do 'x' next session.\" \n\n\nTry it for two weeks.

Start small, but start. Even if you have the structure and checklist prepared, waking up and sitting down to work is usually the hardest part. For this exact purpose, I give myself \"snack tasks\".

I'll say it again, for me at least, **starting** the work is way harder than continuing it.\n\nI also have those days where I work 10+ hours with full productivity, but those days -at least at the start- aren't too different than the days where I feel almost a physical pain just thinking about sitting down to start working. Having the checklist and starting small helps me get the ball rolling and after that I don't find it difficult at all to continue for hours, most of the time I don't even realize that I have been working for X hours.\n\nBonus tip : fix your sleep schedule if it's broken. It's way harder to motivate yourself to work if you woke up at 4pm compared to waking up at 8-10am. Not impossible, just harder.",

What finally broke the cycle for me was realizing that my brain literally needed different systems than what everyone else recommended. The \"hustle and grind\" advice made everything worse because it assumed I could just power through with willpower, but neurodivergent brains don't work that way. I had to build what I call \"external scaffolding\" - basically making my environment do the thinking so my brain didn't have to. Here's what actually worked: I started timeboxing everything the night before, putting every single task on my calendar with specific start and end times. No more to-do lists that I could ignore. I also created artificial deadlines and rewards every single day, not just for big milestones. Like literally rewarding myself for working 2 hours straight, not waiting months for revenue. I duplicated everything I needed in multiple rooms so there was zero friction to start working. Most importantly, I tracked a daily scorecard of just 3-4 things so I could see progress even when the business metrics weren't moving yet. The key was accepting that I needed more structure than neurotypical entrepreneurs, not less.\n\n\n\nOnce you stop fighting your brain and start designing around it, everything changes.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

However, being afraid of messing up is the fastest way to go nowhere.\n\n\\- That said, you also want to learn how to minimize the size of your mistakes. Try doing things in a small scale first then scale up when you get signs that you are on the right path. \n\n\\- Understand that business is probabilistic. So, you can do everything correctly and still fail. Alternatively, you can do every mistake in the book but still hit a bullseye. So, don't get too excited when something works out, and don't get too discouraged when things flop.\n\n\\- Always ask for feedback both from your customers and from your peers. You don't have to incorporate all of the feedback, but at least hear people out because the right advice can make a huge difference.\n\n\\- When you do make mistakes, be kind to yourself. it is part of the journey, and building a business is all about learning and growing as a person.\n\nI could go on, but I feel that these are enough to put you in the right headspace.",

          "body": "You are in a great spot at eighteen because you are asking the right questions before the mistakes pile up. Most people chase “big ideas” and skip the basics. The basics are what actually build a business. If I were mentoring someone starting from zero, I would start with simple habits, not fancy books. Learn how to show up on time. Learn how to communicate clearly. Learn how to listen more than you talk. Learn how money moves through a business. These are the things that matter long before strategy.\n\nFor understanding markets and business models, start with real businesses around you, not theory. Look at a local car wash, a cleaning service, a lawn company, a small shop. Ask yourself how they make money, where the money leaks, and what makes customers come back. You learn more from studying simple companies than you will from reading big corporate stories. Once you get that foundation, books like “The E Myth” and “Company of One” make a lot more sense.\n\nFor mindset, the biggest skill at your age is patience. You avoid dumb mistakes by not rushing into trends, not borrowing too much too fast, and not building something no one asked for. Learn to test ideas in tiny ways. Offer something small, see who cares, and learn from the response. That habit will save you years of wasted time.\n\nIf you want to build problem solving, do hard things on purpose. Work in customer service. Work in sales. Take jobs where real people expect real results. It teaches you how people think, how they react, and what they actually value. That knowledge is gold in business.\n\nAnd if you ever want another perspective as you move forward, I spend a lot of time helping young people understand simple franchise paths and small business ownership. It gives them a clear way to learn how businesses work without having to guess at every step. If you ever want a breakdown of what that looks like, I am happy to share it.",

We've all been there right? So I gave her 30% off my normal rate, brought my project fee down from $4500 to $3000. Told her I remember what it's like starting out and I wanted to help.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I'm helping her evaluate supplier quotes and she casually mentions she's trying to decide between putting 45k or 60k into her first inventory order. Then she's talking about her \"backup funds\" in case the product doesn't perform well.\n\nI didn't say anything but later I'm thinking wait, if you have 60k liquid to drop on inventory plus backup funds, why were you crying poor about my consulting fee?\n\nSo I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.\n\nShe straight up lied to me to get a discount.\n\nNow I'm sitting here feeling like a complete idiot. I gave her a discount because I thought I was helping someone bootstrap their dream. Turns out she was just negotiating and I fell for the sob story.\n\nPart of me wants to tell her I know and revise my rate back to normal for the remaining work. But we're halfway through the project and I already agreed to the price. Plus if she refers other clients to me that's probably worth more than the $1500 I'm losing here.\n\nBut I'm also pissed. I've turned down two other inquiries this month because I'm at capacity and I'm working with her at a discount while she's sitting on what looks like serious money.\n\nMy wife thinks I should just finish the project and never work with her again. My business partner thinks I should confront her because she disrespected my work and wasted my goodwill.\n\nHonestly I don't even know what the right move is here. I keep thinking about all the hours I'm putting in at a reduced rate while she probably thinks she played me perfectly. Maybe she did.",

If the discount is conditional, make it clear.\n\nSo if your normal price is $4500 and you want to give a low income discount, you quote $3000 and state \"30% low income discount\". That way you have something to argue if you discover circumstances aren't what you were told.\n\nBut it's incredibly difficult to row back on a discount once given.  It does at least give you a clear reason not to repeat the discount for future work.\n\n&gt;*So I did something probably unethical. I looked her up. Her LLC is registered, public record. I found her personal LinkedIn. She's not some struggling entrepreneur. She sold a previous company two years ago. I can't find exact numbers but based on the acquisition announcement and her current lifestyle posts it wasn't small.*\n\nIt's not unethical.  It's due diligence.  You should always check out your clients.  It's irresponsible not to.\n\nFinish the project.  Take it as an relatively cheap lesson that you should check out your clients more carefully in future.

There's nothing wrong about that.\n\nAlso when it comes to savings, you never know how people have mentally allocated their money. Maybe that's \"the kids' inheritance\" in her mind, or \"just in case\" money, or maybe she's already earmarked it for something expensive that she hasn't paid for yet. You have no idea, so don't make assumptions.\n\nFinally, as a rule: don't discount your services unless that's part of your business model. Instead, if someone needs to spend less, figure out what you can offer that is inside their budget. If you're normally $100 and she only has $75, figure out what you can offer (profitably) at $75. It's more fair and avoids these kinds of conflicts.\n\nDo the work because you agreed to and you're a person of your word. If you *truly* feel deceived, just decline future work from this person.",

I asked because they had lost majority of their clients due to bad reputation. Ever since the owner started handling customers (after covid) they started feeling too disrespected to continue a business relationship. The brand itself left a bad taste because all they saw was the owner... he immediately said no to rebranding, and they're currently shutting down because they've lost the remaining high-paying clients, struggle to get new ones, and he's fallen ill... \n\nI have so many similar stories. \n\nIf you are running a business, please, detach from it. It's not about you, it's not your value not your worth. If you operate within it, treat it as a job, not as your measure of success nor failure. Remove your pride and work on it as if you're a consultant, make moves as if you're a project manager. YOU ARE NOT YOUR BUSINESS, LET IT GO.",

Alternatively you could pay yourself a bonus on your payroll at the end of the year. A competent CPA/accountant will tell you which you should do and how much.\n\nOne of the benefits to being on payroll is that if your business tanks and you shut down... you've paid into unemployment and can legitimately go on unemployment, or (another likely scenario) you get another job somewhere else, get laid off in a few months, and then you're still eligible for unemployment. And the other is workers' comp - if you get injured on the job, you'll be covered - this is far more valuable than a lot of people think it is. Regular health insurance will be a nightmare to get your injuries paid for once they find out you were injured on the job.\n\nQualifying for a mortgage or loan becomes easier too when you can just show them a normal W-2 and paystub.",

People don't seem to understand I do not have billions in capital like Walmart or Amazon to allow anyone to return anything for any reason. Even Amazon is cracking down on returns due to the increase cost/frequency of returns since the pandemic. \n\n2.

Personal accountability has gone out the window. \n\n3. I do get the option sometimes to deduct from their refund, especially if they sent it back used when it was sold as new, and anytime I do, they bitch and moan about how unfair I'm being. If I sold something and it did not end up working somehow, or arrive damaged, I'm not going to do that, but if you buy a brand new car part that you did not check to see if it would fit, and literally try to force it and then damage it, then that's on you.\n\nI've tried to explain to people I can't keep prices low and allow people to just return something all the time and the recuperation of funds has to come from somewhere, but they simply do not understand nor care. If all retail businesses doled out nearly $1T in refunds last year, where do you think that money is going to come from? YOU, in the form of higher prices. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

Idk where I heard it, so take this with a grain of salt, but the likelihood of recovering funds that are over 60 days past due is like, 15% or something. So as a general rule of thumb, you really want to get ahead of receiving payments as soon as they're 2 weeks past due, and follow up weekly until it is paid. It might seem like you're being nice and patient, but you cannot afford to be patient, you are not a bank. And you're letting your customer dig themselves into a hole of debt. So, here's what you should do.\n\n1. Stop selling to them until they've paid some amount towards their balance. In the past, I've agreed to continue to sell to people like this who had previously had been on good terms, but with the notice that their future orders will be capped at 30-70% of whatever their payment is (depending on how large their balance is, and this number can change as their balance goes down). This is risky, but is a negotiation tool that could help you recover some of the funds while still maintaining a good relationship. You could also offer to accept credit cards for the balance. You might have to eat a 3% fee somewhere, but better than nothing.\n\n2. Adjust your business to be prepared to not receive any payments. Try to cut spending where you can.\n\n3. You can eventually send this to collections, but collections will only give you about 30% of what they recover (if anything). Same with a lawyer, you might win the case, but will likely never see the money, plus you now owe all the lawyer fees. \n\n4. You'll need better A/R practices moving forward. Review your aging accounts weekly, and follow up weekly once the bill is over 2 weeks past due. Notify them in those emails that unpaid bills may result in restricted ordering and finance charges. Then stop selling to them. You are not a bank. \n\n5. If you don't do it already, make sure you're asking for credit references when onboaring new customers.\n\n\nAlso, here's a calculation to see how fast they'll be able to pay off their balance while continuing weekly ordering (not sure how often they actually order).\n\n(Current balance or number of open invoices - target balance or target number of open invoices ) / (payments per week - new invoices a week) = number of weeks to pay off\n \nYou said they had months of open invoices, so I'll just assume 3 months worth of open invoices, and that ordering is weekly, so 12 open invoices. And I'm going to assume they plan to pay two invoices es weekly, and continue to order once a week.\n\n(12 - 4 (4 open weekly invoices = net 30 terms, although, you might want to move them to net 14)) / (2 invoices paid a week - 1 new weekly invoice) = 8 weeks to catch up if you keep them at net 30.\nIf you only want 2 open invoices, it adds  2 more weeks to pay off, if you want the balance at 0, it would be 3 months to pay off if they are paying two invoices a week.",

There is one major player in our area that has bought up a bunch of smaller companies over the years, but they don't have a great reputation with customer service oddly enough. However they are branded well, have multiple officers and warehouses all over the area, you can't even hit a stop light without looking up with one of their vehicles. \n\nI've been tasked to help a company who is taking a slightly different approach to these contracts grow their business but of course that means going after monopoly contracts. These deals are multi-year so when you miss them it could be another 3-5 before you get a chance to bid again. A lot of them also have RFPs, so you can spend a week with a team combing through the details and building a very thought through proposal. \n\nIn the last 4 months, we have been told that we've won 9 contracts that would have been taken from this competitor, however, in every single instance, they had the option in their existing contract to price match and ultimately got to keep it themselves. All the time and effort we put in it just so the big guy can say yeah we'll do that is tiring. \n\nHow can you possibly get past this? \n\nIt's almost all about the money by the way. Corporations, hotel chains, HOA boards are the ones making these decisions. If they can squeak out more money for the deal that's all that matters to them unless someone royally screws up. The little things like we provide better customer service, we're technology focused, increase customer spending etc are all looked at as salesman fluff. \n\nAlso you don't get to meet with the decision makers very easily. Going after a Hilton hotel, the local GM has little say. Going after a neighborhood, there are a dozen people on the HOA board and you may have only spoken to one of them.\n\nWhat can be done here?",

Faster response times, better staff who are treated and paid better so are nicer to the customers etc. Whatever it takes.\n\nThis isn't foolproof though - if the customer has a checklist of requirements, then it's easy for them to overlook the nuances of the quality of those things, especially if they're procuring from head office, where checklists and price are all they're really going to look at....so you really need to go deep on how you are more than just A N Other supplier, so deep in fact that it becomes obvious that the BEST monopoly supplier can do is not even acceptable in your world.\n\nAlternatively, you can play the longer game. Note, I've seen this play out myself, but in the software world rather than services. The principle is the same, however.\n\nYou know when contracts are due up, so instead of waiting for the RFP to be issued, spend 12-18 months running up to it effectively demonstrating how your service is better. Attend relevant conferences and trade shows. Figure out a new process, give it a funky name. Make sure that by the time the RFP is being put together, your approach is already on their lips. Make it so those going shopping are already thinking about what you offer, and then be the ones to actually offer it.\n\nBasically, spend some time in the run up to contract renewals seeding potential clients with you, your approach, and how it's the right choice. The more subliminal / indirect, the better. If you can leave them wanting something and not even knowing who provides it until your proposal ticks every box, then you've done it perfectly.\n\nMake this large company compete with you, rather than the other way around.",

Most businesses work out of the survival paradigm (below 200 on the Map of Consciousness by Dr David R Hawkins), and with the poor reputation that the competition has, but first conclusion is that that company is way low on the scale. The company you represent needs to raise their energies above 200 on said scale. The reason for this is because the message it is broadcasting is \"I need you.\" (everything is energy and those energies are broadcasting messages in the form of frequencies), and those businesses above 200 sends out the message of \"You need me!\". As you are a niche business already, you need to figure out how to raise the bar, improve the energies and messages, and then do amazing!

So we switched to Gusto but it glitched a few times and trying to get a hold of the support team was really painful and slow. Now Rippling keeps coming up in my LinkedIn feed. I’m trying to decide what’s actually worth the pain of switching. We don’t need everything. I just want something that handles multi-state and international payroll without breaking.

Everything is via a \"ticket\" which isn't very helpful when a state agency says there's something wrong with payroll.\n\nThey also cost more than my local CPA's payroll service does.\n\n&gt;I'll go ahead and take some heat. Rippling is an absolutely awful horseshit payroll agency.\n\n&gt;They refused to comply with the laws for workers' comp in my state, insisting that some third-party they use would \"provide my workers' compensation\" (my state has a state-run monopoly on workers' comp). This third-party (and Rippling) failed to open a Workers Comp account, had no place for me to enter my own Workers Comp account number, and never filed any reports with the state, besides saying they did. They also said \"sorry too bad you are locked into a 18 month contract with us and you can't leave and will have to keep paying\" - for a payroll service I COULD NOT USE.\n\n&gt;I consulted with a CPA and an LLM (a type of lawyer who specialises in taxes, nothing to do with AI), and the state Workers Comp themselves. All of them said Rippling was full of shit. But some good news:\n\n&gt;State Workers Comp said they had so many other small employers who had run into this problem - apparently with the third party who actually runs Rippling's payroll, Rippilng doesn't even run their own technology, they hire it out - who mess up state Workers Comp that they would waive all penalties and fees and helped me prepare my Workers Comp reports to get caught up.\n\n&gt;I finally informed Rippling that a qualified CPA, an actual lawyer, and the state itself all said Rippling were wrong. Their response? \"We will be happy to offboard you and refund all charges.\"\n\n&gt;Get a real payroll company like ADP who actually knows how to do payroll. Or just go with your local CPA! Most of them can do it and you will have a REAL person you can call and talk to you when something goes wrong.",

Losing customers hurts, and getting new ones isn’t always easy.\n\nOne thing that actually helps you is email.  \nNothing fancy, just basic emails to old customers.\n\nA simple “Hey, how have you been?”  \nOr “We’d love to have you back.”  \nOr even sharing what’s new with your business.\n\nYou’d be surprised how many people come back just because you reached out.

I want to help you but I’d rather explain the difference between advice and criticism vs. responsibility and ownership \n\nI’d say everyone think that they’re experts and nobody business is going to be a constant uphill, eventually the fall of Alexander the Great was of his own greed and demise, so with that being said you haven’t even become great yet. \n\nAdvice comes from a place of love and kindness. Nobody who can give good advice thinks about themselves, they \nlove hearing stories and love the world in a way that we step out of our comfort zone and help others to find solutions for themselves that we didn’t even think of.\n\nIt is possible to turn this thing around, there is a way out!\n\nIt’s the way you present yourself and your business to its customers. \nSeparate yourself from your business and make sure that your business has everything it needs to succeed. You are the owner. \n\nOwnership and responsibility is apart of the equation. You can’t own up to your faults if you don’t know them.\n\nDon’t take it so harshly because you still made a good deal of money. Whatever you did in the beginning worked! Keep your head up and increase your network, once the network increases, your net worth increases.\n\nIt’s a shame, you do 3.5 million in sales and I don’t even know what your business is. Please contact our group let us know what you do and we can HELP you and give you our coins if we only knew what your business is.\n\nLet’s network together!",

Some positive self talk like “ok I’ve been here before. Not in this exact situation but I’ve overcome a ton to even get here. 10 years ago if someone would’ve said this is the issue, I would’ve been happy to handle this challenge. I got thru this before and I can get thru this now.” \n\nTrust me, I get it. I’m going thru a very similar thing right now in my business. I’m in digital marketing and Google has completely screwed up my business model. I’ve been depressed about it for about 2 years now. Shit ton of work with very little profit to show for despite a lot of cash flow and 21 employees. Complete madness. I always thought I can turn it around.

One slow market doesn’t mean the product is weak, it just means the environment wasn’t there for her to win.what helps after something like this is shifting focus to what she can control. Better markets, better visibility, maybe trying online where crochet actually has a big audience. You can support her by making it clear she didn’t fail like she just showed up to the wrong place. Anyone who creates stuff goes through days like that.Most important thing is helping her not connect her confidence to one event.

If it's quality time -- take her out on a date and give her some of your thoughts maybe over a great meal at her favorite spot. Touch?

They might get 5-6x selling to a competitor that is trying to eliminate competition or make an entrance into a new market. Selling to you, an employee who has worked there, should be around 4-5x max. If they think it’s worth 6-8M you’re never going to bridge that gap. A bank certainly will not give you a loan for $6-$8M. They would give you a loan all day long as long at $4-5M as long as you have a down payment. SBA 7a requires 10% down (the seller can chip in half of that which you’d pay him out over time). Traditional bank financing would require 20% down.",

So it's annoying.\n\nA bank might be willing to extend terms to you for this acquisition, but they will want more of a down payment with a higher interest rate and they will expect your personal assets are more than the other options.\n\nYou could also seek one or more additional / outside investors to partner with, but that comes with a host of other challenges.",

You’d be best served working with an advisor of some sort if you do this - a broker, accountant or lawyer. \n\nWhat industry is the business in, what is included in that purchase price, does the purchase price include any real estate? What’s the revenue on the business? \n\nThe valuation is potentially high but you need to be extremely specific here. Is the “approx $1M income” $1.0 or $1.9? Is it net income or EBITDA? Do you have visibility into what any adjustments to those earnings are? For example, how much are the owners paying themselves, have they purchased a lot of personal or capital expenses lately? For a business with $1.0 million in adjusted EBITDA, I think 3.0-3.5x is fair value. \n\nA valuation you agree upon to purchase a business is separate from a valuation a lender will order. Very similar to purchasing a home - the appraisal will come in unsurprisingly similar to the agreed upon price most of the time. \n\nFor a loan, you’ll want to look for a PLP SBA lender in your area. They will want a minimum of 10% down from you. If you don’t have 10% down, then you’ll need to raise equity. The SBA loan has a $5 million loan max. \n\nGood luck.

I proposed to my dad that we buy the 50% share of the old partner and lets run it as our own within our family. \n\nI orchestrated the whole deal and negotiations with the old business partner. After we purchased the 50% share of the business, I have implemented so many new systems that make mine and my dads life so much easier. I have hired great employees and created a social media presence. My dad works about 30 hours a week now compared to his 50-60 hours before with his partner. They both weren't running it right.  I still go to the business about 7 days a week just  to oversee operations. On paper the business is entirely in my dad's name. I put 50k of my own money into buying out the old partner.\n\nThe problem is, its been 3 years of me working almost everyday, sending my parents on vacation and making sure they're good. Holding down the family business. My dad has not once proposed to pay a single dime to me. I don't want to make it about money at all because I care way more about the relationship but I am getting a little frustrated by doing a lot of work and him not even offering to pay me at all. He has been taking large distributions from the business as I work hard. I just feel like im getting all of the headaches with none of the benefit.  I dont know how to approach this situation at all without ruining a relationship. Just venting lol",

If you invested you should be part own, even if it’s not 50% and from my understanding of tax law both partners need to have draws equal to their percentage. Ie if you’re 70/30 and the 70 draws 100k you have to draw 30k if it’s 50/50 then if 1 draws 100k the other also has to draw $100k. If you’re not a legal partner then you need to be a legal W-2 employee with wages paid. Which would mean you’re due back pay as well. You guys screwed yourselves by not figuring this out from the beginning and letting it continue for 3 years! You need to talk to an employment lawyer. I’m not a lawyer so don’t take my word for it, do your own research/hire a lawyer to confirm/deny my understanding of this.",

          "body": "What was your dad's former business partner paid for his shares? In my mind, you should at least be due whatever percentage that $50,000 represents of the value of the company. If the partner was paid $100,000, for instance, you should theoretically have a 25% stake in the company (in practice, even if not on paper). So if your dad takes out a $12,000 disbursement, you would get a $4,000 disbursement. There are obviously tax implications to consider since you aren't technically an owner. \n\nI would certainly consider asking dad to formalize that ownership percentage. If you simply \"loaned\" him the $50,000, it seems to me that he could legally sell you some percentage of the shares (I am not a lawyer or accountant, just a guy who has at times had a similarly complex \"handshake\" partnership in a family business). It will be a lot easier for you to stomach technically working for free if you're seeing that benefit. \n\nI'm also curious about his plans for the business when he's no longer around. Do you have siblings? Are they involved in the business? It's important that this is spelled out now, because you wouldn't want there to be any questions once he's gone. It's possible you risk some hurt feelings bringing it up- but it's almost a guarantee of bigger hurt feelings later if there's no plan.",

I work a lot of extra hours from home but it's important for me to be present in my office during our typical work day. I had a boss in the past that was never around and it caused poor morale and lots of animosity on our team, so I vowed to always be present and a team player in my own practice.\n\nI dress as if I was in a hospital outpatient clinic, wearing work pants and blouses, but always paired with fun earrings and colorful vans or flats. As a medical professional I do feel it is important to present as a \"professional\", but I like to show that I still have personality, and I push boundaries more in my own practice with style than I could have when I worked in a hospital. \n\nWe have a business line for our patients to call, but I never give them my personal cell. A handful of them I see for home health and they have my Google Voice number so that they can reach out to me if something comes up and they need to cancel.\n\nI think a lot of these answers depend on your field. Medical professionals in private practice will likely give you different answers from founders of a startup brewery or graphic designers that can work remotely. There is definitely beauty in all the different possibilities and options for business owners. Being able to do it our own way is one of the best parts of being a small business owner!",

Some clients are offended if you are all business, some are offended if you aren't. General rule of thumb is to let them set the tone of the relationship within reason, and to know how to switch back to business mode when appropriate. \n\n(Some clients try to use personal relations to get freebees.

Sometimes that turns into 12 hour work days, sometimes it’s two hours in the afternoon and I can relax the rest of the day.\n \nDress: Any face to face with clients or B2B is collared shirt and slacks up to a suit, depending on situation.  If it’s phone calls all day, I’m in PJ’s.\n\nCleanliness: How clean my workspace is, is directly tied to my productivity and how in compliance I am with security measures required by my clients.  The beginning of my work day and end of my work day have 5-10 minutes of cleaning my office.  It is not inaccurate, but everything has a specific place and needs to go there.\n\nPackaging: Clients pay for packaging and shipping.  I have organized labels and folders for clients in a cabinet and purchase the shipping box/label at my local Fed/ex.\n\n\n Work Gear:Bar code inventories with depreciating asset spreadsheet for all big ticket items (computers/printers/badges).  Small things (pens, notepads, whiteout) are written off, but purchasing is tracked, capped, and must be authorized if monthly cost goes above allocated.\n\nPhone: I do not have a work phone, however I really only deal with B2B. I do not get customers calling me for quotes or general questions.  With my business, it’s understood that all that stuff will be discussed during an actual set meeting.  Almost all tedious correspondence is conducted via email, which I only use on my work computer for security purposes.\n\nOverall, If I am working with others, I tend to try and be incredibly professional, however that’s the nature of my business (Government Contracts).  If I am on my own, I’m taking breaks with my dog, watching tv in the background, doing choirs or a playing a few rounds of a video game for a break. I am also wearing PJ’s the whole time.",

Don't do vid calls. I dress in shorts and t shirts in the summer. Jeans and a casual lumber jack style shirt or jumper in the colder months. Most of my meetings are face to face so that I can physically show client's our products etc. I will wear chinos and a nicer shirt and office shoes or boots for those. \n* How clean do you have your workspace and desk? My desk is a mess 90% of the time, not helped by the antiquated paper based production system we have! \n* If you have a physical / digital product you sell, how do you handle your packaging and wrapping? Physical 90% B2B branded merch in the hundreds per order usually. Bulk packed in cardboard boxes of 10-60pcs per box. \n* What about company branded gear/work wear? We make the branded stationery. Branded shirts etc.\n* Do you use different phones to not mix clients for work and personal? Office phone connected to an app. Couple of clients whatsapp on personal number.",

This may or may not work for you.\n\nI have worked from home in both company roles and entrepreneurial roles and the thing that has made the biggest difference for me is structure. I do my best work when I have a defined start and end time (when possible - of course OT is needed at times). When the day feels open ended I lose focus fast. When I give myself a real beginning and a real wrap up I stay sharper and I feel like I actually put in a proper day.\n\nI also need a real workstation. A desk that stays relatively clean. A chair that feels like it belongs in a workplace. I dress comfortably for most of my day because that is part of the perk of working for yourself, and I will level it up for client calls because it shifts my mindset and it signals respect.\n\nThe little things matter too. I try to keep my space tidy because my environment affects my energy. I keep my digital world clean as well which means naming files properly and organizing folders so I am not hunting for things. \n\nI only use one phone but I keep strong boundaries on notifications and work hours so things do not bleed together. For me professionalism at home is not about pretending I am in a corporate office. It is about choosing habits that support the kind of work I want to do and the way I want clients to experience me.",
