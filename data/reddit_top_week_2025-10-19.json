From my very first email, I told them about the existing offers and made it clear that I wasn’t looking for lowball bids.\n\nThey still insisted on proceeding, so we went back and forth for about two weeks. After all that, their final offer came in at $25K. Totally made my day.\n\nThat’s all you need to know about this company, it's a scam.",

You are reviewing website designs before they launch. You give feedback on how easy or difficult their pages are to navigate before they release it! If you get up to 5 stars on feedback (very easy) you will be offered more tests. \n\n Pocket7Games- (Code for free money/tickets is sxqgquU) I got really good at a game on this app and genuinely made $200 from two games. It is fantastic just master a skill game. It is still “gambling” though since you’re playing against other people so don’t be dumb haha\n\nMeete- (Code for free money/coins is L9SHAZ) When you’re in a pinch you can get paid quite a lot either chatting with the men on here or telling other people to sign up to chat with users. I typically just share the affiliate link like I am now but I have also made a lot of money just chatting too. I DO NOT send anything NSFW but it seems like people who do tend to earn more.

So a few days later, I did my own research (im careful, but i think that's for the best) and more and more i realized how the whole thing worked. Because you hedge any bets you place, you are always making sure you have all of the outcomes covered so technically you can't lose and I know it sounds too good to be true but really it's just math. And then you use sportsbook promos to extract actual money. It's not a get rich quick thing but that's not what i was looking for, just wanted a small hustle i can pick up whenever i have time and not worry about it.",

      "selftext": "I’m an Automotive Technician with over two decades of experience.  I’ve always worked for a dealership, but recently formed my own business on the side.  I went through all the legalities of doing it the correct way; where I registered with the state and county that I’m in, got my EIN, and opened a business account.  Once it was all set up, I made a website, leased an office space and started advertising on social media.\n\nIt started out slowly— after the first 30 days I was questioning whether it was even worth it.  I barely made enough that month to cover business expense.  However, it began to snowball after I landed some mid-tier jobs and started to get 5 star reviews on Google.  Consistent advertising through instagram fueled the fire, while creating content on YouTube on the cars I was working on showcased my skills.\n\nFast forward today and after a short 7 months in operation, I’ve managed to build roughly $38k in business capital— all net profit.  The jobs I’m landing are also getting bigger.  I’m billing out dealership-level work orders and gaining repeat clients to boot.  Most recently; I performed a major engine overhaul on a clients car that was billed out at nearly $7k.  A week later he dropped his other car off with me to get it up to snuff on maintenance and any other repairs it needed.\n\nAs the work becomes consistent, I’m finding it difficult to juggle both the W2 and my own “side business”… which as of late I consider more of a full time business than anything— as all of the free time I have outside of the W2 is dedicated to building the business and scaling it up.  I know at some point, I’m going to have to choose between the two and I’m already strategizing how that will play out.  If things continue to accelerate at the pace that it has been, I see myself making the side hustle my main hustle and just picking up a part time job as a bartender or something… start networking and gaining clients that way.\n\nWhen I formed this business, I had my doubts on whether it would amount to anything.  Now I’m proud of what it has become and excited to see what it will eventually be.  \n\nBest advice I can give anyone that’s thinking of starting something on the side is this:  \n\n•Identify what you do best, and capitalize on that and that alone. (I’m a Mechanic… wouldn’t make sense for me to open a food truck).\n\n•Be prepared and put systems in place to keep you organized- keep your books tight.\n\n•Realize there will be monetary risks.  Start small, budget wisely, and don’t get over leveraged.\n\n•You will make mistakes- learn from them.\n\n•Don’t chase $, chase client satisfaction and those 5 star reviews.\n\n•The reward reflects the time and effort put in.\n\nHope this was interesting and that it inspires some people.  🔧 \n\n",

      "selftext": "I used to treat tools like toys, fun to play with, but not serious. I’d mess around for a bit, close the tab, move on. But somehow, a few of those random things ended up quietly making me money.\n\nHeyEtsy was one of the first. I only even bothered opening it because someone mentioned it in some random Reddit thread. This thing actually shows you what's really selling, not just what's, like, all over your feed. I started using it to just peek at the real numbers before I wasted another 10 hours designing totally random crap. That tiny shift literally saved me from launching a dozen flops.\n\nThen came CheckEtsy basically, it tells you which keywords actually convert. Not “trending,” not “hyped,” but selling. That’s how one of my listings accidentally became my top earner. Not because I was smart, I just followed the data for once.\n\nIdeogram and Midjourney completely blew my mind, too. Instead of literally slaving away for hours designing from scratch, I could just pump out a bunch of concepts in minutes, pick the decent ones, and quickly clean them up. It wasn’t even about 'AI magic,' really, it was just about pure speed - getting to the next idea way faster.\n\nAnd this one still kinda trips me out: some random little Google indexing tool I stumbled upon online. It basically made my pages show up on search way, way faster. Nothing fancy, at all, but it was like a secret shield, making sure all the stuff I'd already bothered building didn't just vanish into the internet abyss.\n\nNone of these tools made me rich, obviously. But man, together they just shaved off all the soul-crushing, boring parts and let me actually focus on the fun stuff. They basically kept my side hustle chugging along while I was busy pretending to take breaks.\n\nWhat’s the one tool that ended up helping you more than you expected?\n\n",

Export them neatly (transparent PNGs, SVGs, etc.) and either sell them on marketplaces or offer them free with ads and a paid tier for extra stuff.\n\nBonus tip: create your own website and sell without a commission.\n\nThere's a big audience of YouTubers, indie devs, and small creators who need quick visual assets but don't have the skill or time to draw. You could turn your skills or past drawings into a simple side hustle.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been digging into what it really takes to turn a blog into a money maker in 2025, and one thing keeps coming up is consistency. If you publish only once in a while, you’ll never build enough momentum for search engines or readers to trust you. It is the bloggers who post weekly or more tend that scale much faster when it comes to traffic. Over time, that regular output compounds into more keywords, internal links, and authority, which are all essential for real income growth.\n\nMonetization usually starts with ads and affiliate links. A good benchmark is RPM, which means revenue per 1,000 pageviews. Currently, I have monetized my blog with Google Ad sense and the RPM usually hovers around $10-15. \n\nLooking at more successful blogs, many now report around $20 to $30 RPM on average across combined ad and affiliate income. For example, 20,000 monthly pageviews at a $25 RPM equals about $500 per month. \n\nOnce you meet traffic thresholds, you can also apply for premium ad networks, which often pays $12 to $30 or more per thousand views. AdSense and similar networks pay differently by region, with traffic from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. earning much higher rates. As your blog grows, you can add digital products, sponsored posts, or courses. Blogs with multiple income streams can reach $50 to $100 RPM or higher.\n\nThe potential is real. But you need consistent posting, good SEO, and the patience to build authority. If you’re starting or trying to grow a blog this year, focus on steady publishing, optimizing for high-value countries, and gradually improving your monetization setup.\n\nIf you have any questions about monetization and the likes, let me know.

Ask me anything you want to confirm.) \n\nIt’s a walking app.  You don’t need to spend tons of time on it, but it won’t make you rich either.  It’s just for a few extra bucks here and there.  You COULD put some time in it and make quite a bit more, but you don’t have to just to make a few bucks.  \n\nYou just log in at the end of the day and collect your steps with one button push.  If that’s all you do, it’ll take awhile, but you can still make money.  \n\nThings I do to speed up making money on it now are:\n\n-1 survey a night for like 5 minutes.  They are too boring for me to sit there and bang out, but you could do a bunch if you wanted.  \n\n-collect the “cards” Around town as you walk.  \n     -I do it if I’m riding passenger in a car.  Just open and and grab the daily seven cards as you pass them on the street lol.  \n\n-very occasionally play a game if it seems fun or they are running a bonus.  \n\n-referrals here and there when I can get them.  \n               -you get points and so does the person entering the code.  \n\n\nI have made 50-75 a month doing this for a bit now.  Not a killer income, but requires very little effort.  \n\nMy referral code is : \n\nPeacefulRhinoceros9144\n\nFull disclosure: I get 100 points and you get 150 points, or “wards” as they are called, once you reach 200 wards on your own.  You could do that the first day too if you did one or two surveys, or just collect your steps at the end of the day but it’ll take a little bit longer.\n\nOne of many apps I run to get low to no effort gift cards or Venmo.  Yes, they do pay out.  It takes like three days or so once you submit your cash out to get the gift card or Venmo.  \n\nHappy to answer any questions too.",

What people need to understand is that we are putting in the work, but with the current economy, our earnings from 9-5 jobs barely get us by.\n\nWe barely afford basic things like food and rent with the money we get. This is why many Gen z are quitting their 9-5 jobs and embracing remote work and side hustles culture because why exhaust ourselves with 8+ hours in a job which hardly satisfies our needs. We'll rather take our chances with remote work and side hustles because they give us a chance to build reliable wealth and mostly don't cause us burnouts like 9-5 jobs. \n\nGen Z are really trying ",

How did the rest of us deal with it do you think?\n\nWe’ve all *had to try* mate, what makes Gen Z so different? \n\nI have a suspicion that you’ve grown up seeing shorts and YouTube videos, influencers making millions, and feel like you’re entitled to a job that you perceive is fun or low effort. \n\nI do agree that the 9-5 Mon-Fri job is outdated and it’s well proven now that 4 day work weeks make the right people in the right roles more productive and happier, but that doesn’t really apply to a huge number of roles which need people, say, 24/7 (medicine, care, service). However - you need to realise jobs are an exchange. \n\nYour time for their money. \n\nYou are not entitled to their money, you have to offer them value for it. If you have a USP/skills that not many others have, your time will be valued higher. But they will need that time from you in order for them to get the value that makes them keep putting money in your bank. \n\nThis whole post just reeks of main character syndrome. Everyone needs to be *special* these days. Put social media down and realise that the world has so much to offer you but you have to look for it. Be cool, be interesting *and interested*. Realise you don’t get money without something to offer in exchange. Work doesn’t have to be a chore, but you don’t get your dream job handed to you on a plate.",

For the last 30 days I tried a simple rule: before 9am, do one small, slightly uncomfortable action (5–10 minutes) that measurably moves the side hustle forward. No bargaining, track a paper streak, keep it realistic.\n    \n    \n    Examples I actually did (reputable platforms only):\n    - eBay: photograph and draft one listing (even if I publish later)\n    - Upwork: improve my profile headline or tailor one proposal (no mass‑apply)\n    - Etsy: rewrite one listing description for clarity and keywords (no gimmicks)\n    - Uber Eats: check my schedule and set a 90‑minute block for later in the week\n    \n    \n    Why this helped me:\n    - It converts “I’ll do it tonight” into a concrete morning win\n    - 5–10 minutes is small enough to avoid excuses but big enough to create momentum\n    - The streak keeps me honest without over‑optimizing\n    \n    \n    Questions for this sub:\n    - What’s a compliant, 5–10 minute “first action” you’ve used on a reputable platform that clearly helps (not spam or mass outreach)?\n    - How do you prevent this from ballooning into a 45‑minute session that burns you out before work?\n    - On days you’re wiped, what minimum keeps the streak alive without pretending it’s progress?\n    \n    \n    Not asking for work or offering any — just looking for realistic, rule‑compliant ideas that have genuinely helped you move the needle.",

Also hired a graphic artist to do all the graphics for my page and the ones used in my videos.  Taught myself Davinci Resolve for video editing as well. After about a year with no success I kinda burnt out.\n\nI started posting a few videos again since last week and views and watch time have started to pick up again.\n\nI plan to release a video every week but does someone have advice on how to grow and promote my channel? In particular how to translate all those views and watch hours into subscribers?\n\nI've already done pretty much everything that is usually listed on Google posts on the topic.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Maybe you will learn to start a business of your own!\n\nGet in your neighborhood Facebook groups, or create flyers to put in people's mailboxes and ask people what they need help with--anything they need, no job too small or too weird. Ask folks what tasks they have been putting off in their houses that you could potentially help with that don't require any real skills or tools that they don't already have. The holidays and New Year's are coming. People feel the stress of having stuff left to do. There are also many elderly people who don't have help and are also lonely. There are many things you could do for folks! Cleaning out garages? Cleaning out car interiors? Cleaning up dog poop? Helping overwhelmed moms do their laundry?

From Mar–Oct chased \"passive income\" (lol nothing about it was passive).\n\n**What flopped:**\n\n* Dropshipping: 2 chargebacks, $64 ads, net –$118.\n* Etsy: 9 orders, 3 returns, AI template subs ate the tiny margin.\n* Domains: $212 spent, 0 inquiries.\n* Crypto: almost aped into a telegram \"gem,\" nephew yelled at me, backed off (ty nephew).\n\n**What actually paid (small but real):**\n\n* YouTube (packing tips): 17 vids, 1.3k subs. Last 4 months  $103.47 (RPM \\~$2.1). \\~5-6 hrs/wk filming/editing.\n* Turo (2022 Prius): 9 days booked last 3 months, gross $358 → after Turo fee/insurance/cleaning, net $237; minus a $35 tire patch = $202 take-home. Spent \\~25 minutes scrubbing a stale coffee smell out of the Prius before a pickup - renter no-showed anyway.\n* Task monkey (chrome extension) - funny enough, I tried it on Amazon October Prime Day last week and it got me like $138 back from price drop. Probably the only thing I'd call \"passive income.\"no link/ not affiliated.\n\nHalf a year in, I don't buy the \"work hard and it’ll click\" thing anymore. Most of this stuff is the same tricks with a new label. You put in hours, spend a little cash, and it stalls out. The only money I saw was small and hands-on. Not passive - just extra shifts on a different screen. If you've got something that really pays without babysitting, I'm listening.",

It surprisingly took off: the world leaderboard now has over 3,000 farts logged from 100 countries. At first I just wanted to see if something that absurd could go viral, I now added a personal leaderboard recently so users could compete with themselves. Already six people have signed in with google and i'm so happy to say I have pushed my revenue from $1 to $2.46 (mostly through affiliate clicks). It’s not life-changing money, but it’s validation that even the weirdest ideas can earn something if you: Build fast and iterate based on feedback, Find joy in a micro-niche and don’t overthink “scalability” early on.

I mean, really, there's no exact science, but those that are afraid to \"click a link\" because someone is trying to make money. I mean, I get it, tons of scammers out there. But, this attitude? Do you buy from Amazon? Walmart? Just like everyone hates on MLM companies. Said company has a product for the said entrepreneurs who sign up to sell said product. I mean, many of the products actually just sell themselves really, but other times, it's literally like pulling teeth. I can only imagine if the car salesman had just as hard a time selling a car as an MLM product? Or, what if the car salesman was required to be a business owner in order to sell the car provided by someone else? \n\nStarting a business isn't rocket science, but in this day and age, it takes an arm and a leg to getvone started and then another arm before your first client or sell. And yet, you'll hear people say things like \"should have earned a degree\" or \"maybe you should find a better job,\" \nmeanwhile, people trying to actually come up in the world and start something from nothing? With this attitude 😒 \n\nMake sure you don’t click any links. Someone might actually earn something. Just because you're having a hard time doesn't mean you can't find 10 to 20 dollars to support someone and their endeavors.\n\nYou literally have people (like me) trying to help others and find ways to benefit everyone. \n\nWe literally need to be building each other up instead of tearing them down.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been on Etsy for 2 years. When I launched my very first shop, I got just **1 sale in the first month**. After years of testing and learning the platform, my **6th shop** did **180 sales in its first month**. With the right strategy, sales grow month after month after launch.\n\nHere’s what it really takes to reach **3k a month:**\n\n1. **Daily posting.** Add new listings every day. Refresh old ones (photos/tags/descriptions) from time to time. The algorithm loves activity.\n2. **Product selection = competitor analysis.** I use eRank to study competitors’ bestsellers and only post products that already have proven demand -then I **remix** them into my own version (design, bundle, offer).\n3. **Discounts are strategy, not decoration.** But also, I’ve seen a shop with 40k sales that didn’t run “% off” but used a **bundle offer** like “Take 2 posters and get 50% off the pair.” It is also good strategy haha.\n4. **Don’t “sleep” after launch.** Many people open a shop and then post nothing for weeks. Etsy gives you a **Start boost -** if you miss that window, it’s harder later.\n5. **Bad start? Reset fast.** If your shop is cold for 1-3 months with no clear reason, **close it and reopen** with a sharper niche, storefront, and strategy. It’s faster than trying to revive a dead listing set. (I had this situation before)\n6. **Consistency or nothing.** My friend hit 1k in first month with 3 bestseller listings. When those cooled off, she stopped uploading. She doing one listing a week, and it isn’t enough. **Daily momentum = steady growth.**\n\n**A note on timing**\n\nThis month many sellers (me included) noticed odd shifts - sales dipped like Etsy tweaked something so much. If you’re about to start, consider waiting a couple of weeks for stability. Use that time to prep listings, bundle offers, and your daily posting plan.\n\nI have my own paid cheap on this topic, but I'm not linking it here to follow sub rules.\n\nLet me know what you think about :)",

None of these worked for me because I was very introverted and didn’t have the knowledge to persuade people to buy what I was selling. By arbitration I thought it was drop shipping and that just seemed like a bad idea unless you have permission to sell people stuff. Affiliate Marketing seemed like you are just trying to make people join something that you don’t fully understand and once I understood what a pyramid scheme was that’s what I saw in every business plan. \nBasically by pyramid, there is someone on top and the lower “legs” or level, or hierarchy or whatever you want to call it. Different levels of management is called a pyramid so I still think it’s in everything like the government, corporations, businesses, etc. \n\nSo I found something that works for me!\n\nIf you feel like you need to get away from all of the business stuff, the pyramid scheme, the classes that cost too damn much and all the gurus that can’t help\n\nLISTEN UP!\n\nSo when I found this thing called making money from your phone ten years ago, I was curious!\n\nHow do you make money from your phones?\nIt was of course part of a bribe or a marketing scheme that will get you into an affiliate marketing campaign called Imarketslive. \n\nI’m not promoting their products or the business but I am promoting what they taught me. \n\nSo, as detailed as possible, currency was created after the barter system. When people saw the value of trading people’s resources they were then “enslaved” by materialistic things like gold, silver, bronze, wood, hay, bricks, rare metals and stones, upon other things.\n\nSo people found a standard system on which to trade which is the gold standard. Gold is traded to determine how much currency you have to purchase building materials, machinery, equipment, livestock, food, etc!\n\nGold along with money is transferred from the trading markets to the banks, held in vaults and only exchanged for big profits. \n\nA standard 24 karat gold bar is worth between $4,000 - $5,000 USD\n\nA 400 ounce gold bar is $1.3 million dollars or more!\n\nSo, instead of carrying around all of the gold from country to country, we made something that weighs less, can be easily replace, and is easier to transport.\n\nWhen technology advanced, we now can trade with the banks buying into money and trading with the banks as “retail traders” \n\nA retail trader is anyone that has the means to trade online but doesn’t have a corporate bank behind them to trade money. \n\nSo, now that you’ve reached the end I don’t want to borrow more time from you that I already have or you will have to message me to learn the system or process that I use to trade thousands of dollars on my phone or my computer without any work other than looking at fluctuating prices and lines that should be common sense.",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

If you are starting an online business or getting into online work you should know that: 1. you need a proper plan to create a new market, create a completely new job idea; 2. every kind of work that you start up online is a small investment itself, which means you will most probably spend money trying to earn money (im also talking about advertising your product/service/whatever); 3. low effort jobs and no skill jobs are not well paid jobs (not worthwile), you must possess some kind of skill.\n\nDon't listen to Youtubers, try searching around forums and chats online and maybe, but maybe youll get lucky. You need to find a good contact or agency or smth\n\nThe market is oversaturated for most kinds of existing jobs, in order to earn money doing simple work you should travel in time 15 years in the past\n\nTake time doing what youre doing, patience is important, getting a good amount of money in a short period of time (less than a month) is highly improbable\n\nThe last thing is advertise your stuff, be the most annoying you can be with it, share it everywhere\n\nI know all of this advice is well-known stuff already, but im trying to help anyone new who wants to start online, hope i did.

That’s not how it works.\n\nPassive income isn’t some magic loophole that prints cash. It’s the reward for front-loading the hard work putting in the effort *now* so you don’t have to later. Every person who’s built something that earns passively has paid in *either time, money, or both.*\n\nIf you’re starting from $0, that’s fine but be ready to grind. Learn copywriting, create digital products, start a YouTube channel, build a blog, anything. But if your plan is to do nothing and somehow earn something, you’re better off buying a lottery ticket.\n\nPeople love the idea of “passive income” because it sounds effortless. But in reality, it’s just *delayed effort.*\n\n  \nIs there *any* way to start truly passive income from $0 without investing a single hour or dollar?

Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

They picked one thing and actually gave it time.\n\nOnce I stopped looking for shortcuts and started learning systems that work (AI tools, automation, simple offers), things shifted.\n\nIf you’ve been watching others make moves, maybe it’s time to stop watching.

      "selftext": "I feel like most people on this page don't actually understand what passive income is. By no means am I a pro, but here is what I do. \n\nI live in the Dominican Republic, and have started with a few investments. I have a motorcycle that I bought for $400 and a Tri-moto (basically a three wheeler but has a truck bed in the back of the motocycle.) Which are commonly used to haul building materials, trash, or help people move as well as many other things. The Tri-moto was $3000. Every day, except for Sunday the motorcycle brings in $4 and the Tri-moto brings in  $12. Weekly that is an income of $96, minus the $18 I pay to someone to manage this. So every month I'm making $312 for doing absolutely nothing. \n\nI know it's not much. But it feels great to be getting these systems started. It's about 10% of what I need to live my life, so a good start. The plan now is to save 100% of this until I can get another tri-moto. \n\nFeel like I need to say this because everyone here is always selling a course. Well, I don't have one. Just common sense. Find something someone needs for a job, and rent it to them. Everyone wins. ",

          "body": "Building $3,000 per month in passive income will take time, but it’s absolutely doable if you focus on the right systems and lean into your strengths.\n\nGiven your experience in IT, Agile, and coaching, one of the best places to start is creating and selling digital products based on your knowledge. That could be templates for project planning, Agile sprint boards, training slide decks, or even Notion or Airtable setups for productivity. You can sell these on Gumroad or Etsy. Once created, these digital products can generate income over time without ongoing work.\n\nYou could also consider launching a small online course or coaching bundle. You don’t need a big production or a huge audience. Even a short workshop or a focused email course can be sold on platforms like Gumroad or Teachable. With your background, people will pay to learn how to manage projects, navigate Scrum roles, or improve productivity in their own teams.\n\nAffiliate marketing is another path worth exploring. You can earn when someone buys through your link, and this works well when you’re recommending tools you genuinely use or believe in. The key is to learn how to make persuasive content, whether through blog posts, short videos, or email guides, that helps people make a buying decision. I walk through how to do this step by step in my newsletter if you’re interested.\n\nGiven your love for cooking and healthy living, you could also create a faceless YouTube channel, digital cookbook, or a healthy meal planner. These kinds of content can be monetized through ads, affiliate links, and digital product sales. It’s not instant, but over time, it can grow into a reliable income stream.\n\nPrint-on-demand could also complement your creative interests. You can design wellness-themed journals, recipe logs, or even merch with positive messages and sell them on platforms like Printful through Etsy.\n\nYou already have the discipline, knowledge, and mindset. Now it’s just a matter of choosing one or two paths and going deep instead of wide. I break down each of these ideas with examples and tutorials in my newsletter. Feel free to check it out, the link is in my bio.",

Your experience in Agile and project management gives you the structure and consistency most people struggle to build.\n\nIf I were you, I’d focus on turning what you already know into small, repeatable systems that can run with minimal effort. For example:\n\nDigital courses or templates for Agile and Scrum professionals. You can create things like sprint planners, team-building exercises, or short leadership workshops and sell them automatically.\n\nHealthy lifestyle or productivity printables. You already live that life, so share what works for you through planners, checklists, or habit trackers.\n\nAffiliate blogs or newsletters. Start one around self-improvement or healthy living and use affiliate links for tools or books you already recommend.\n\nWorkshops that turn into self-paced products. Host a few short sessions, record them, and sell them later as evergreen content.\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to build one thing that earns $100 a month and then stack it. Thirty small, consistent earners will reach your goal. Focus on creating simple, useful products and automating everything possible.\n\nIt might take a few months to build momentum, but with your mindset and skill set, it is absolutely within reach.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Overnight successes were generally years in the making. There’s no magic money tree that just makes you wealthy without effort. If you want a magic money tree, you have to find some soil, plant a seed, water it, give it the right nutrients, protect it from storms and the cold and the heat, prune it, and give it time to grow and blossom. Does that sound passive? It’s not.\n\n2. You have to just pick something and start. The thing you pick should be something that you’re interested in and have an aptitude for. Instead of consuming everything you can about get rich quick ideas, consume everything you can about the thing you picked. Become an expert.\n\n3. Find a way to start inexpensively. Businesses are generally set up as fixed cost or variable cost. A fixed cost business has expenses every month regardless of what your revenue is. Rent, employee salaries, insurance, etc. A variable cost business generally has costs associated with revenue. If you’re a reseller…you get orders for a product, collect payment, and then get the product and ship it. Without the order, you had none of those costs. When you are just starting out, try to donut the variable cost way so that you can test the concept without going broke.\n\n3. It won’t be passive. So find the right Sub to join to talk about working for yourself. Sidehustles or entrepreneur is more appropriate.\n\n4. Starting a business is almost like having a kid. It requires a lot of time, and effort. It’s not easy, but it can be very rewarding at the same time. But you are committing a significant portion of your time (now and in the future) which comes with sacrifices. \n\n5. Get excited! Because passive income IS possible. It just requires time/effort to build.\n\nGood luck!",

It doesn’t matter if it’s design, automation, or marketing. You’ll only figure out what fits once you start doing.\n\nBuild one tiny thing that could help someone. A simple template, a landing page, a workflow, anything. It doesn’t need to be perfect, just real.\n\nGet feedback right away. Post it, share it, or show one person who might care.

          "body": "Start with digital products. Use Canva to make a simple planner, template, or tracker and put it up on Gumroad or Etsy. You don’t need a niche or audience yet. Just focus on creating something useful and getting that first listing live.\n\nOr try print on demand. Sites like Printful let you upload designs and sell them on things like shirts and mugs. You can connect that to Etsy, so you don’t need to run ads or build a store from scratch.\n\nAffiliate marketing is a great path too, but you need to learn how to make content that actually persuades people to buy. That’s where most people fail. I explain exactly how to do that in my newsletter.\n\nYouTube is another legit option, even faceless. It won’t make you rich overnight but once it gains traction, the passive income potential is real through ads, affiliate links, and sponsorships.\n\nIf you want to sell physical products, try dropshipping through eBay. eBay already has traffic, so you don’t need to waste money on ads. Just learn the basics, pick a product, and get it listed.\n\nFor long-term financial growth, start investing in index funds. It won’t solve the present, but it builds the future.\n\nMost people who finally started earning didn’t find the perfect idea, they just took imperfect action. I break all of this down in plain language in my newsletter, no fluff or hype, just step-by-step how to get your first win. Link is in my bio.",

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they’re advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don’t usually need to prove it, because they’re not trying to sell you anything. I’ve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it’s not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow. That’s usually where people give up right at the beginning when it feels hard or slow.\n\nBottom line: **Effort = Results.** If you’re serious about it and want to talk more, feel free to DM me.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

      "selftext": "Hi there! I wanted to ask if someone is having the same problem as me: The Oneforma platform seems to be really glitchy as of late, but I never had problems with my Task queue. I worked perfectly last week, but when I tried to login today, first I was faced with an \"Out of connection\" error. When I could finally login, my task queue was completely empty, as well as my job history/applied jobs etc. I can't even edit my payment or job information. \n\nIs someone else experimenting this? I've tried to fix the problem by clearing my cookies and such, but I can't simply log in to work on my task queue. I am a little baffled because the communication with my project team has been really good, and I haven't received any offboarding email... I sent an email to them just in case too, but I still wanted to ask.\nThank you for your answers in advance.",

I completed the qualification and received an email on October 8th about completing an identity verification process in order to stay on Project Sonic, as well as set up possible payment method?\n\nPoint is, I completed the qualification task and identity verification shortly after receiving said email.\n\nI never got an email confirming that I could start working on Project Sonic (it was mentioned in the qualification email that I would get a follow-up email indicating whether I passed or not). However, when I go to the Multimango platform and login using the provided credentials from TelusInternational, I can see tasks that are available to work on (again similar to Project Coffee on Crowdgen). Does this mean I could start working now? It'd really help considering Project Coffee has been paused for many users (including myself) while they undergo quality reviews.\n\nIf I can start working on the project, how exactly will I be paid? I don't think I was able to add any payment information on my TelusInternational account nor was I prompted to use any app.\n\nAny advice/help would be appreciated.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI started this site 6 days ago with zero coding experience. Using Claude AI to help me build, and documenting the journey here.\n\n**The Niche:** Plant-based milk alternatives (oat, almond, soy, coconut, cashew)\n\n**The Hook:** Interactive quiz that matches people with their perfect plant milk based on use case, taste, values, and dietary restrictions. Results page has Amazon affiliate links.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n*Day 1-2 (Oct 9-10):*\n\n* Built quiz on bus commute using Claude AI\n* Launched on [noncow.com](http://noncow.com) (domain I already owned)\n* Set up Google Analytics, Search Console, Amazon Associates\n* Added Schema markup\n\n*Day 3-4 (Oct 11-12):*\n\n* Posted to r/vegan (8.3k views, 58 comments)\n* Posted to r/dairyfree (1.9k views)\n* First sale! $1.69 (someone bought a kids' winter jacket after clicking my oat milk link 😂)\n\n*Day 5-6 (Oct 13-15):*\n\n* Got roasted in comments for UX issues - people couldn't get accurate results\n* Completely rebuilt quiz algorithm based on feedback\n* Added blog structure with first SEO article: \"Best Plant Milk for Keto Diet\"\n* Separated quiz from homepage for better funnel\n\n**Current Stats (Day 6):**\n\n* 240+ total users\n* 36 active users this week (steady \\~9/day post-Reddit spike)\n* 30 Amazon clicks total\n* $1.69 earned (1 sale shipped, waiting on more)\n* 4.76% conversion rate (30 clicks → 1 sale)\n* 306 events this week (8.5 actions per user - good engagement)\n\n**Traffic Sources:**\n\n* Reddit posts (main driver)\n* Direct/word of mouth\n* Waiting on Google to index blog content\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\n* Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)\n* GitHub Pages (free hosting)\n* Amazon Associates (only monetization)\n* Claude AI for code help\n\n**What's Working:**\n\n* Interactive quiz format gets people engaged\n* Reddit responds well to \"I built this\" posts\n* Quiz-to-affiliate-link funnel converts at \\~5%\n* User feedback loop helps iterate fast\n* Traffic sustaining after initial Reddit spike\n\n**What's Not Working Yet:**\n\n* No organic search traffic yet (too new)\n* Reddit traffic is spiky, not sustainable long-term\n* Need more content for SEO\n* Low returning visitor rate (everyone's new)\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Write 2-3 more blog posts targeting search keywords\n* Submit sitemap, wait for Google indexing\n* Maybe add email capture for newsletter later\n* Consider Reddit strategy for consistent traffic\n\n**Investment:**\n\n* Time: \\~12 hours total (evenings + commutes)\n* Money: Claude Pro $250/year, domain $12/year\n* Total: $262\n\n**Questions for this community:**\n\n1. Should I focus on more blog content or drive more Reddit traffic?\n2. How long until Google starts sending organic traffic typically?\n3. Anyone else using AI tools to build faster?\n4. Tips for converting one-time visitors to returning users?\n\nHappy to answer questions about the process or share what I've learned!\n\nSite: [noncow.com](http://noncow.com) (mods feel free to remove link if not allowed)",

Even our team shortened it to \"c2t\" in calls because nobody wanted to say the full thing.\n\nFor my next project, Linkedin content AI tool, I went radically short: 2pr\n\nHere's what happened. When you give an extremly short and meaningless name, people instinctively add the domain when they mention it. They say \"2pr\\[.\\]io\" instead of just \"2pr\" because saying just \"2pr\" sounds awkward or unclear. (hopefully moderators will get that is not a link but core feature of the post/story)\n\nThat becomes a clickable hyperlink automatically.\n\nMost of our signups come from direct links now. People share the name in Slack channels, LinkedIn comments, Reddit threads. Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

However, when something wasn't going right they were the biggest pain in the ass. One time, we didn't have the right business license in this state we were about to do a show in and it was 4:30PM on a Friday, one of my dedicated people (but not good at sales) called up the local license place and they said they had already closed for the day and she went and found a neighbouring town, called them up and begged them to stay open for a few extra minutes took a cab and drove out there and got the license. All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

We signed a few big clients, hired more people, and for the first time, we’re actually profitable. But now it feels like we’ve hit a new kind of chaos. Everyone has cards, subscriptions multiply overnight, and invoices pop up from random tools that nobody remembers signing up for. Last month, I found out we’d been paying for two different analytics platforms because two departments didn’t realize they were using the same thing. We’re not “corporate” enough to hire a CFO, but I’m spending way too much time trying to figure out where money’s going. I’ve tried using Google Sheets and QuickBooks tags, but it still feels like patchwork. For those of you who hit this stage how do you keep visibility without micromanaging? Is there a system that actually works for small but growing teams?",

But I would say absolutely not everyone should have cards, and every charge should be authorized by someone who is looking at the transactions every month. You can then categorize things like how much should we spend on software, how much did we spend on business meals, how much did we spend on advertising dollars, and then you can see where you need to watch out. This also will help you with your taxes. \n\nOnce you get into a groove, most expenses should be predictable and recurring. This is actually a great use for AI. You can export your transactions and create a project for expense review. For example you have a long list including things like:\n\nAsana\nEverhour\nGoogle Workspace\nSEMRush\nSupermetrics \n\nSo you tell the GPT what to expect and what’s normal, and then every month you upload it and say tell me what charges are out of the ordinary and anything that’s changing, something like that.",

Same deliverables.\nThis time they paid instantly.\nNot because I suddenly became affordable, because they were tired of chaos.\n\nThat’s the funny part.\nMost clients don’t leave because of cost.\nThey leave because your process feels like applying for a passport.\n\nYou can literally double your rate if working with you feels smooth.\nPeople pay for peace of mind, not pricing tables.\n\nSo yeah, it’s not your price that’s scaring clients away.\nIt’s the friction. The waiting. The micro-annoyances.\nThat “I’ll get back to you soon” email that takes 3 business days.\n\nMake it easy to say yes.\nThat’s the real discount.\n",

Honestly it's just frustrating, Here's hoping that frustration eats me alive enough To push me forward.

      "selftext": "All subscription companies eventually figure out the Monthly to Annual Plan pricing trick.\n\nI ran growth at Codecademy from 10M ARR to 50M ARR and this trick probably drove 30% of that growth. \n\nThe trick is to price your 12-month plan to be slightly more than your average LTV for monthly users.   \n  \nSo, if your average user stays around for 4 months, just price your annual plan at 5 months.  \n  \nYou get to boost LTV for these users by 25%, which is a huge win for not a lot of effort.  \n  \nWe did this at Codecademy, and it was hands down one of the most effective tactics we have ever tried.   \n  \nIt shifted a material amount of users to long-term plans, which increases LTV, drops churn, etc.  \n  \n**Also:** The big implication of this is that you can look at any mature subscription business and basically guess their user retention by looking at the ratio between their 12 month and 1 month prices.  \n  \nNetflix: Only offers monthly plans, meaning their average user stays around for over 12 months.  \n  \nHeadspace: $12.99 for a month vs $69.99 for a year. Ratio of 5.39, so their monthly users likely stay around for \\~4 months.   \n  \nCalm: $14.99 for a month vs $69.99 for a year, ratio of 4.67, so their monthly users probably stay around for \\~3-4 months  \n  \nIf you want to see what company in each category is probably the best at retention, look at pricing ratios",

I keep reminding myself why I am building my start-up. At this point, getting a 'good exit' is not even at the top of the list (although that would be nice!). I have started this to solve a problem and need to see it through.\n\n2.  See if you can build a 'support system' - I have a buddy who is also going through a similar journey and we have agreed to keep talking to each other about our pain points. \n\n3. Listen to your body - at least as a solopreneur, I have some degree of freedom with my schedule. I usually listen to  energetic music when i work or go workout, shower, etc. when I need a break. Sometimes I even take a nap in the middle of the day and then slog it out late in the night. The key is to understand what keeps you in your productive zone most of the time and try to do more of that. High Productivity/Passion =&gt; Less Stress.\n\n4. Have something that you can look forward to. For me, I keep (kept? - more below) my Friday evenings to just unwind with my favorite food and drink. I'm back at it first thing Saturday morning, but Friday evening is my time. Through out the week, I imagine myself sitting on the couch on Friday evening and ask myself 'what do I need to accomplish before Friday, that will help me enjoy it more?' and the work towards that.\n\n5. Go Public! Recently, I went public with my startup on LinkedIn (nerve wracking, yes), but that is driving a new level of accountability that I don't even want to do my Friday ritual anymore (LOL). It is not just the fear of public failure, but also the motivation from listening to people's problems and how I am working to solve those.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nPS: Yes, I have read Tim Ferris' \"4-Hour Work Week\", but haven't truly figured out how to make it work for my situation.",

If you're in business, you're answerable to your stakeholders, employees, your banker, regulatory authorities, your spouse, your kids, whomever. There are people who will benefit from your success or will suffer from your failures.\n\nI get that being a business leader gives you freedom to make decisions, but with that freedom comes great responsibility, and I think for me at least, that's the driver that keeps me going, no matter what. After a while, you get accustomed to it, more thick-skinned and you become a very powerful engine in your business. Then the secret sauce is the quality delegation. Quality people in your business will make things happen. On the flip side, poor hires can cost you greatly.",

I just wanted to share my thoughts. Later, it turned into a tool for building my reputation, and now I’m not even sure: am I running LinkedIn, or is LinkedIn running me? :)\n\nToday, I’ve gathered some numbers, results, and fun facts, and answered some of my followers’ questions.\n\nDo recruiters and HR people reach out? No, not really. And that was my plan. Here’s why: I’m not job-hunting and don’t position myself as a candidate. I’m building the reputation of a strong marketer and an engaging storyteller. I think that protects me from offers I’m overqualified for or simply uninterested in. That said, I have received several great inquiries, ones definitely worth attention, for senior roles, mid-level positions, and personal brand management.\n\nI just write about what interests me. My topics depend on that. If my interests change, maybe my “strategy” will too. Probably more about work, since now I have one.\n\nDid I find a job? I did. I’m not sure LinkedIn directly helped, but thanks to it, I’ve had side gigs that have totaled about $1,000. That wasn’t my goal, though.\n\nI didn’t expect such rapid growth or to reach such high numbers. So far, I’m satisfied :)\n\nI’ve garnered 3.6 million impressions, gained over 7,000 followers, and written 270 posts, averaging 128 reactions and 30 comments.\n\nOverall impression, I like it. I’m grateful to the people who read me. It makes me happy, and I encourage everyone who enjoys writing to just keep doing it, even if your reach isn’t impressive yet.",

We both work full-time on it, but she thinks since I handle most of the sales and make slightly more from commissions, I should cover all the rent and expenses until things “balance out.” I don’t see it that way we built this together, and I think we should both contribute fairly, even if not perfectly evenly. Last month we actually missed paying rent on our office space because we couldn’t agree who should transfer the payment. I’ve been playing on my phone at night trying to find advice on couples who run a business together, but everyone says the same thing: “separate personal and business money.” Easier said than done when you share both.  \nHas anyone here built a business with their partner? How do you handle the money side without it turning personal or ruining the relationship?",

Makes tracking profits (and taxes) way less stressful, and you’ll both actually see what’s coming in and going out. And honestly, it’s not a bad idea to look into prenups or formal agreements too.

Don’t buy into the “AI is a bubble” hype, it’s complete BS. \n\nWhat gets missed in the sea of massive build in public MRR chart porn shots on X is that even a lot of the people lying about their revenue are probably profitable and doing ok at much smaller amounts.\n\nI started an AI landing page service called Vibe Otter thats working out really well, was profitable at about the one month mark. We’re at the 3 month mark and nearing $1k MRR which sounds lame compared to VC world, but is pretty good in normal people world - if I weren’t in a high cost of living area I’d already have line of site to financial freedom through it.\n\nIt’s profitable because completely non technical people can make truly professional websites within a few hours.  We have a partner who’s using our service right out of college with no technical experience making so much money her friends think she is dealing drugs because she’s selling websites at the market price of $3-10k she can make for a few hours work with our agent. \n\nThe hardest part is always finding customers. We’re competing against multi $B unicorn startups, and it’s hard to explain how we are better since they flood the market with exaggerated claims (we offer a MUCH simpler user interface that is more appropriate for complete non tech people). \n\nThe truth is, AI is so NOT a bubble, the real thing I worry about isn’t profitability, it’s moving too slow and getting eaten up by the bigger AI companies everybody claims are the bubble.",

          "body": "The API cost ceiling is real - several commenters nailed this. I've seen teams burn $2-3K/mo on GPT-4 calls before realizing they could cache 80% of responses or downgrade to 3.5 for non-critical queries. The profitable AI businesses I've tracked share one pattern: they didn't start as AI companies, they added AI to solve a specific bottleneck in an existing workflow (driver routing, product descriptions, lead personalization). The ones that launched as 'AI startups' without a clear use case usually pivot or die within 6 months. On pricing: the successful ones charge for outcomes or time saved, not per AI call. If you're pricing per generation or query, your margins get crushed every time OpenAI raises prices. Better to package it as 'unlimited X for $Y/month' and manage your own cost efficiency internally.",

That’s where something like Petpooja POS actually makes sense; it’s built for real restaurant workflows instead of generic automation.\n\nWe use Petpooja’s automation suite for a ton of stuff that used to eat up our time:\n\n* Automatic WhatsApp follow-ups after dine-in or delivery to collect reviews (and good ones push directly to Google My Business).\n* Smart inventory alerts that reorder supplies when we’re running low.\n* Payroll automation through Petpooja Payroll calculates attendance, overtime, and salary in seconds.\n* And even invoice management that reads paper bills with AI and logs expenses instantly.\n\nIt’s not flashy, but it actually *saves hours* every week. In 2025, I think the best automation tools aren’t about doing everything; they’re about doing your industry’s *tedious repetitive work* automatically so you can focus on customers again.",

Doesn’t matter if it’s AI tools, dashboards, or marketing automation, what pays is the *ability to identify a problem and ship a working solution*.\n\nIf you go all in on AI tools, you’ll learn both **data** and **marketing** naturally along the way. Because you’ll need to find problems, validate them, build, and sell.  \nSo instead of thinking **which skill?,** think **“which ecosystem do I want to dominate?”**\n\nIf I were you, I’d pick AI tools for businesses. It’s tough, but if you can build one real solution that saves companies time or money, you’re set for years.\n\nStart by building micro-tools → get feedback → improve → charge → scale.  \nIn a year, you’ll be dangerous.\n\nCurious though, what kind of businesses are you thinking about targeting?

Local Market Research to find out the workflows, pains and also how they use AI. Google/Talk to AI, find indirect competitors in other markets /global ones that you can copy.\n2. TODO: Analyze a specific local industry (Country/Language). Focus: Which questions should I ask myself?\n3. Call the companies and ask them a series of questions followed by asking them if they would pay for it.\n4. Also ask if it is OK for them if you add them to your CRM-system and contact them when the product is live\n5. By doing this you get a CRM-database with potential customers\n6. Develop the easiest first solution.\n7. Email them and offer them a demo or to test the software.\n8. This makes them feel \"ownership\" over this idea.\n9. This build trusts and you can either deliver the next product or ask them: Would you like this too?\n10. Potentially, with enough trust, and recurring business you could ask for money to develop the issue (Retainer/targeted customer funding).\n\n\\---\n\nMake sure you do versions of the business documents for your project and make new ones until you feel you are ready. Which ones are important?\n\nFor any AI-driven development: What documents should you have finished first, which could be included as skeleton files for the AI to populate.\n\nIf you use AI for help with documents make sure you have a system in place for organization of files.  \nEither do this locally on your computer, with drive or with Notion.\n\nCareful: Making a decision for part in a doc, might require you to change a lot of other docs.  \nMake sure you have your documents mapped out to know how they relate to eachother.   \nThis will help you.",

As we see with the news today, you'll want to create a recession proof business  that will ALWAYS be needed and you can't be laid off from. Think laundrymats, plumbing, HVAC, electrician, UPS stores, etc. These are all things that except for a zombie apocalypse will always be needed. For example, I chose nursing as my career because as long as humanity lives, I'll always have a job, and it's a diverse and scalable field. I would say pick something like that, take an apprenticeship, work your way up and eventually open your own business. I would avoid AI only because the market is changing so fast, it may be difficult keeping updated when self-taught. Don't focus on lots of money fast, PLEASE focus on **sustainability**. Think of the tech startup boom from a few years back and how many people today are laid off.  People have to have clean clothes, lights, working drains, etc. whether the market is up or down. Over the long run of your life, constant, steady, stable and infallible income will bring you more money, and ultimately PEACE OF MIND (as you age, you will realize that this/work-life balance is worth more than anything. Your body/mind won't be 19 forever) than quick fads ever will. Hope this helps!",

Clocked over 8-9 hours a day on average coding everyday. It's not an AI wrapper but still, I feel like so many people underestimate how long a real project takes.

I have validated my current idea directly through people and groups and have listened to competitor's negative reviews and feedback.

Rather, it should prove the point of solving a problem in a specific way. If people want it even if it looks ugly and fails, you got product-market fit.

I even tried to start two businesses with my friends, but both failed (the first, my friend and I stopped liking the project, and the second one, I was the only one putting in the time, and then I had a burnout) before even having an MVP. I know it's my fault, but I am just saying.\n\nI have around 3 years of software engineering experience and 1 year in sales, since I do it as a side-hustle.\n\nNow I want to go in and build something, but after my burnout, I feel like I am having some trouble having ideas and starting again. And I am afraid of never leaving this wantrepreneur stage.\n\nI don't care about being rich, I just want to build something that helps make people's lives better and be able to maintain the flexibility I have from working remotely.\n\nCan you guys give me some tips on how to leave this stage?",

Standard stuff like lawn maintenance, seasonal cleanups, mulching, the usual.\n\nAbout 8 months ago I had this one client who kept asking if I could pressure wash their driveway while I was already there doing their yard. I said sure whatever, charged them like $75 extra just to not deal with scheduling another visit. Took me maybe 30 mins.\n\nWord got around I guess because then other clients started asking. I figured why not, easy add on right? Fast forward to now and I'm getting calls specifically for pressure washing. Like people don't even want the landscaping part anymore they just want their driveways, decks, house siding done.\n\nDid the math last week and the pressure washing stuff brought in almost double what the landscaping did last month. I've got some money saved up from the busy season and Stаke so I could buy better equipment and actually pivot to this full time but it feels weird abandoning what I started with?\n\nAnyone else deal with something like this where a side thing accidentally became the main thing?

These were considered \"throw-away\" devices. They'd last maybe 5 years and then would break somehow and the business owner would have to buy a new one for anywhere from $5k - $12k depending on the brand because no one provided repair services.\n\nSo we offered to try and repair it. We did basically the same thing you did, $100 and we'll try to repair it. We were successful. I wrote a blog post about it on our company website and within a week we started getting calls about the service. It was crazy. We started receiving 10+ calls per day about this service. We completely pivoted our focus to only this service.\n\nTo find our pricing we simply kept on increasing prices until people started pushing back.  So now we charge about $1,200 for a service that costs us a couple hundred to provide.\n\nNow we're nationwide and Repair about 10,000 of these devices per year and growing. Sure there's competitors now, all who have spawned from ex employees, but we're doing great. Totally life changing.",

      "selftext": "Hey fellow Redditors,\n\nI own a burger joint that I've been running for 6 months now. Since day one, I've been giving a free burger to a homeless guy who comes in 3 times a week. I've always been happy to help him out, but last week, things took a turn.\n\nHe came in on a Saturday, and I had to tell him I couldn't give him a free burger because I was running low on product. I offered him a side of fries instead, but he lost his temper and started cussing at me. He claimed I was 'full of shit' and that I had plenty of product, which wasn't true.\n\nAs the owner, I'm used to dealing with difficult customers, but this guy's behavior was unacceptable. I yelled at him to leave and told him not to come back.\n\nI know some of you might think I'm a jerk for cutting him off, but honestly, I feel like he took advantage of my kindness for too long. Has anyone else had to deal with a similar situation? How did you handle it?",

He asked to use our bathroom, I said no (we didn’t have a public restroom), his response was “I’m not going to do drugs in there”, which made it an extra no. I asked him to leave.

But we're known for our produce (and we're also a SNAP retailer) so it's a necessity. Produce has different phases: A Grade, B Grade, Free Grade, Piggy Grade, and Compost. We don't have enough B Grade to warrant a trip out to a food rescue organization so we started a \"free table\" where we would put unsellable but still edible produce and other items. Folks from all tax brackets would take from the free table but most importantly: food insecure folks could take from it without having to feel awkward about it.\n\nWell this one unhoused guy decided it was his personal buffet and would eat from it all day. I started offering him bags to take anything he wanted to go. He decided that outside of our store was his home. He would try to come in after closing hours to ask for more free food. One time, I was working from inside the locked store (lights were off and blinds were down) and I felt someone staring at me. I looked up and he was bent down so he could stare at me from under the blinds. That was the first time I called the cops.\n\nWe stopped putting out the free produce for a while because he creeped us out so much (for a multitude of reasons). Customers expressed disappointment so when we hadn't seen the creeper for a long while, we decided to bring it back. Well then creeper man got out of jail and resumed his antics. I was setting up the table and ran into him and we had a nice conversation where he seemed sober + thanked me for feeding him. I offered him a to go bag and he informed me that he was planning on hanging out because he likes it in front of my store. I very politely gave a reason for why he should hang out in one of the more comfortable spots in the area and he went ballistic. I tried to deescalate the situation and he threatened to kill me. I called the cops again, got a different officer, who informed me that sometimes people say things they don't mean.\n\nSince the cops don't care about the safety of my team + my neighbors, the free table is gone permanently and the good free stuff goes to the unhoused people in the neighborhood who periodically check in on us to make sure creeper man hasn't been bothering us.",

My partner says I'm miserable every Sunday night. My friends say no client is worth this stress.\n\nBut here's the thing - $5k/month is $5k/month. That's half my income.

Part of me thinks \"just rip the band-aid off\" but then I panic about paying rent.\n\nHas anyone been in this situation? What did you do?

Use that time to find new clients. When they bring it late, do it at your normal pace. You’re training your client at the same time, so I wouldn’t flip around the first time and drag feet. Start gradually slowing down to a normal pace. His failure to meet your deadline doesn’t mean you should be bending over backwards now to meet his. \n\nFamily business is a tax office/business consulting firm, doing accounting and payroll. We tell folks to have docs in 5 days before an IRS deadline or it’s an automatic extension or late filing. If they get the documents in after our deadline, we do the extension and then do the tax return the week after the deadline. We can’t do “last minute” work for every client. \n\nNow, doing payroll and bookkeeping/accounting has generally helped tremendously. I’ve got access to a bunch of their tax documents ahead of time and now don’t have to wait for their P+L, W2, whatever. Firm is up to ~250 clients, 40% of that growth over the last two years. Remember, CPA’s are aging out and retiring, while new grads aren’t meeting those numbers. BLS estimates ~110-120k retiring and 30-40k entering. Finding new clients will be super easy. Tell your existing clients they’ll get 10% off if they bring you a new client. We only take referrals, zero advertising. \n\nThe other thing that’s been a huge help is doing the business consulting piece and helping people do their AOI, EIN, 2553, etc filings. We now have a client from the start, set them up on QB, price out basic bookkeeping services at $75/month, and we tell them to let us know when they’re ready for payroll. They now bring us their business tax return, personal tax return, parent/sibling/neighbor tax return, then these new business owners go to some networking event to push their business and tell the other new business owner about how our service got them up and running inside of two weeks. Now we get another phone call and help close out the other business owner’s 2553, QB setup, then get their business tax return, personal tax return, sibling’s tax return… it’s quite easy.\n\nDM if you’d like. Would love to chat.",

For example: does this client send things late? Put him deadlines and do follow ups. Invoices are all disorganized? Sure dedicated accounting software can help that. There are tons of tools that can help you with that.\n\n\nSecond thing are boundaries, it's unaceptable that a client forces you to stay awake during those hours, so aware them of that kind of things wich may not seem that relevant to your client's eyes. ",

I would usually charge $60 for a project like this but gave her a discount and told her it would be $50. I prefaced it by saying that cost conversations with friends/coworkers can be awkward, but that custom cupcakes are time consuming and then shared the price. She said “$50 for 12 cupcakes?!” My face turned bright red and I was like “um yeah… if you want I can do toppers rather than a custom design and lower the price.” And then she was like “no, I want to showcase your design so it’s fine, I’ll pay the full amount” as if she is doing me a favor… \n\nI’m guessing this is a common experience for small business owners. Just looking for some solidarity because even though I know she was wrong, I’m still feeling mortified. Also wondering if this price sounds shocking to anyone else? Thanks for reading❤️",

You’re not Safeway.\n\nEdited to add: some quick advice I learned from a former manager: in the future, try not to project what you’re feeling onto your client. “I know pricing with friends can be awkward” just made it awkward and named a feeling they may not be feeling but are thinking about now. Be confident in your pricing. “I usually charge $60, but for you I’ll do it for $50. Sounds fair?” And let them respond. Your response of adjusting the product to meet their price point was perfect. It gives them options in their price point so they feel like they’re in the drivers seat.",

Half the receipts get lost, nobody remembers what category things belong to, and by the time I match everything, the month’s already over. It’s not even about people overspending I trust the team it’s just the administrative chaos that eats away hours every week. I’ve looked at some apps that claim to “automate” the process, but most feel like overkill or require everyone to constantly log in and upload stuff.  \nWhat do you all use to make this less painful? Ideally something that doesn’t require a whole finance department to manage.",

Not looking for any more comments, sales pitches or people telling me to work harder and cold call business.\n\nAnswers to the so so so many comments about exactly the same things....\n\n1) we are residential cleaning  \n2) it's a lead gen business not a direct cleaning company. But we respect our cleaning contractors, pay them well and support them properly \n3) we have great retention of contractors so stop telling me I'm a shit leader.\n4) yes we have recurring customers 90% of our bookings are weekly/fortnightly \n5) no I don't work 1 hr a day. That's just for the moment while I have a newborn child. When i can get more than a 2 hr block of sleep before having to change a nappy or support my wife breast feeding I'll go back to 60 hr weeks\n\nNow back to the original post so you can all roast me even more\n\n============\n\nI've been running a semi successful cleaning business for 10 years.\n\nHave stagnanted at $300k annual revenue but have really struggled to get past that level.\n\nLast 18 months we've fallen in to Google's dislike pile and have been loosing traffic month over month.\n\nTried fixing things but got on the bad side of the June/July core update and out traffic has almost zeroed out \n\nGoing from 800 organic clicks per day 18 months ago to 10 per day now.\n\nHad a couple contractor teams leave. Latest one is going for surgery due to cancer in a week.\n\nJust had my first child a month ago.\n\nAnd I think I'm fucked. \n\nI can't recruit new teams unless I get the bookings. And I can't get the bookings unless I spend money on marketing. And I don't have money unless I get bookings.\n\nI've spent over $100,000 on SEO \"agencies\" that were essentially BS.\n\nGAds is way different now that it was 8 yrs ago.\n\nI've spent $20k on GAds in the last 6 months and made about $10k from those ads.\n\nAnd this contractor leaving us for cancer surgery makes me think I don't actually have a business anymore.\n\nAm I stuck in sink cost fallacy? Do I actually have a business at all? What do I do if 10yrs experience turns to shit?\n\nI need to voice this out loud and don't want to speak to my wife about it. \n\nNot sure what I'm looking for. Maybe I just need to vent.\n\nEdit: in Australia not US",

You were likely able to really maximize the bang for your buck under the old structure, and no one except google is going to know for sure why it changed and/or what you can do about it.\n\nYou would not be at all the first to have this problem after a major update. Any time this happens, some companies get crushed. It might be possible to recover, but also possible you just had the perfect mix of whatever factors mattered. As time goes on, people will know better, but then as more people know, they’ll change it again. \n\nSo you can keep spending money on SEO and consultants, but you’ll probably just burn it all. I know there’s going to be some consulting firm out there that actually has a very good idea of what the changes are, but that’s going to be impossible to truly determine you’re going with the right one, except doing it and seeing the results.\n\nSo just comes down to how much money you want to gamble. Could work, could not. \n\nIf your risk tolerance is low, I’d look at selling your business based on the value of the brand / customer relationships. For all you know some actual large cleaning company might want to buy it, and do the actual cleaning themselves. So they’d essentially be buying your customers off you in that case, which likely has some value.",

You could try to represent yourself but generally that's not a great idea, but if you do hire a lawyer you should know you're probably going to pay as much (if not more) than you recover from the client. If you try to represent yourself, you could potentially recover a lot more of the money for yourself but you're also more likely to lose.\n\nThey probably have limited cash with which to pay their vendors right now. The squeakiest wheel gets the grease first, and right now you're not one of their squeakiest wheels. In other words, they're only paying the bills that are causing them the biggest problems right now. And you're not one of them. So if you want to get your money, you have to make your bill one of the ones that's causing them the most problems.",

I would not be inclined to go the legal route without one.\n\n1.  Does the contract say anything about recovering attorney's fees?  If Yes, then send a demand letter, reference that section in the contract and make it clear that on mm/dd/yyyy this matter is getting turned over to your attorney and the legal fees that \"YOU Mr. Client will be responsible for,\" start adding up.  If No, then now is the time to add that language to your contracts going forward.  I would still send the demand letter and note that you will be seeking attorney's fees, just be a little less specific about the details.  Whether or not you actually CAN recover such costs at the end of the day is a question for your attorney.\n\n2.  Does the client have assets?  Can they be made to pay up if you win?  Only $14k, I would expect so, but if not, it might not be worth the bother because you could get a settlement and not be able to collect anything.  If Yes to both 1 and 2, then hand it off to an attorney to go after them for the $14k plus costs.  If No to 1, but Yes, to 2, then you just gotta make a judgement call.  I'd figure legal expenses would be $5k minimum if it ends up actually going to court.  You could probably get away with less if a lawyer's demand letter or the court filing itself is enough to get them to pay up.  I think it's worth doing, but you have to understand that you might be throwing good money after bad.  Court is always an expensive gamble.\n\nMost deadbeats will pay up once you actually file in court.  Some will just ignore it, never respond, and never show up at court.  Still others will fight you to the absolute bitter end even if they have little hope of victory.  A-holes gonna A-hole.",

Then I tried GetResponse, and for the first time it just clicked. It literally took me 30 minutes to set up my first email funnel and I was already collecting leads that same night.\n\nThe biggest difference for me: ✅ drag-and-drop automation that’s actually visual (no code) ✅ built-in landing pages and sign-up forms (no need for extra tools) ✅ free plan to test everything — no credit card, no traps ✅ and it doesn’t feel like you need a PhD to use it\n\nIf you’re a small business owner or someone trying to start affiliate/online sales, this thing’s a time-saver. It basically runs in the background while you sleep.\n\nYou can check it out here 👉 https://www.getresponse.com?a=rETjTTWvkJ\n\n(They have a 30-day free trial — I started there and never switched back.)\n\nJust sharing this because I wish someone told me earlier before I spent weeks struggling with other tools. Hope it helps someone here too. 🚀",

Like share supplier info or warn about sketchy deals and refer customers when we can't help them. One told me about a logistics company that cut my shipping by 30% and another saved me from a supplier who doesn't reply after first orders.  \n  \nBig chains dont hurt us much since our customers want local and they always complain stuff isnt in stock there anyway.

You can appeal and wait 30 days.”\n\nNo reason given.\n\nNo summary of their decision.\n\nNo timeline to recover my funds.\n\nResult:\n\n\\- €50,000 frozen\n\n\\- Business operations halted\n\n\\- Dozens of detailed emails ignored, no clear response\n\n\\- My opinion after this experience\n\nWise is no longer a reliable solution for professionals.\n\nThey act like a bank — but without transparency, accountability, or logic.\n\nTheir compliance team feels robotic, demanding contradictory and absurd documents, often impossible for small businesses to provide.\n\nAnd the worst part: they can shut down your account without warning, even if your file is clean.\n\nHonestly, it’s shameful.\n\nI regret ever trusting them.\n\nIf your business relies on Wise — withdraw your funds while you still can.\n\n❓Questions for the community\n\nHas anyone else here had their Wise account closed with money stuck inside?\n\nHow long did it take before you got your funds back?",

          "body": "Yes! Leadership in general is a muscle that needs to grow in the beginning but firing is always hard. My mentor always said the day firing is easy is the day you shouldn't be a leader. You need to make the right decision for your business but it's not easy knowing that person is losing their job. Especially in a small business, you more than likely know their family or at least know about them.  We should always maintain our compassion.\n\nThis is probably my driving force behind hiring very carefully, because I haaaate terminating. I like using interview guides with predetermined questions and 1-3 answer ratings so I'm very clear on who I need to hire and my notes are the data to back them up. I like pretty much everyone when I meet them and the interview is the best you're going to get.  I never hire on the spot and typically try to have someone else I trust in the interview for additional perspective.  I always give myself time after the interview to really think through their answers.\n\nI have seen so many things go wrong when clients wait to fire too. They put it off and every single time, it ends in a dumpster fire. Property damage, reputation with vendors or customers destroyed, workmans comp injuries- I've heard/witnessed some wild stories. \n\nKeep performance notes so you can make an educated decision and have regular performance conversations with your employees so it's not a surprise. This also keeps your top employees happy because seeing poor behavior or poor performance tolerated will demotivate them right out the door.",

It plugs directly into Intune and Azure AD, so you can automatically sync enrolled devices, users, and software data instead of chasing spreadsheets. It’s built for distributed setups. I work for IT in a construction company. We have warehouses, remote teams, contractors, all that chaos.\n\nWe're using AssetSonar to track every hardware and software asset. We also brought in devices from Intune, JAMF, SCCM, and similar tools. We do use role-based access so regional teams see only what’s relevant. AssetSonar also helps track license compliance which is huge if you've O365 or Adobe suites your employees are using.\n\nWe switched to it about a year ago and it immediately exposed a ton of ghost devices and duplicate records that were invisible in Excel. Once everything was normalized, audits stopped being a nightmare.\n\nIf you just need something quick to pilot, they do have a free trial. Try spinning it up, connecting Intune and you’ll see your inventory appear in minutes. Even if you don’t end up keeping it, it’ll show you what single source of truth actually looks like.",

What began as freelancing for a couple of clients slowly turned into a real operation now we’ve got steady work, a few part-time contractors and things are finally stable. Lately my girlfriend’s been showing interest in joining me fulltime. She’s great with organization, social media strategy, and client communication basically all the things I struggle to stay consistent with. On paper it makes total sense, but I can’t help wondering how it might affect the relationship long-term. We get along really well, but mixing business and personal life can get tricky fast. If we argue about something work related, it could easily bleed into everything else.  \nFor those of you who’ve brought your spouse or partner into your company how did you make it work? Did you formalize it with roles, ownership or just play it by ear?  \nAny lessons you wish you knew before doing it?",

      "selftext": "I hit 2 years running my dtc brand last month. Made some money but also made some really dumb decisions that cost me. Sharing so maybe someone else avoids this stuff.\n\nFirst mistake was thinking I could handle all the marketing myself. Spent 6 months posting on instagram and running terrible facebook ads. Burned through 15k with almost nothing to show for it. Finally hired someone who knew what they were doing and sales tripled in two months. I should have done that from day one but I was being cheap and thought I could learn it myself.\n\nSecond mistake was going with the cheapest manufacturer. Saved like 30 cents per unit but quality was garbage. Return rate was almost 15 percent and the negative reviews killed us. Took 8 months to recover our reputation after switching to a better supplier. That 30 cents ended up costing me probably 50k in lost sales and returns.\n\nThird one I just learned about this year. Got a legal letter about our website not being accessible to disabled people. Had no idea this was even a thing. The lawyer wanted 20k to settle and we had to scramble to actually fix the site. Apparently this happens to a lot of small ecommerce companies and nobody talks about it until it happens to them.\n\nEach of these felt like they came out of nowhere but looking back there were warning signs I just ignored. The manufacturer thing especially, I knew the quality wasn't great but kept making excuses.\n\nDoes anyone else have surprise expenses from stuff you didn't know you needed to worry about?",

The unanimous conclusion has been that this is impossible. Different disabilities have conflicting, sometimes entirely opposite needs. For example, a countertop that’s wheelchair accessible could be completely unusable to someone who can’t safely bend down. A website with highly contrasting colors to accommodate people with low vision could be nearly impossible for someone to use if they have sensory issues or migraines. An allergen-free cafeteria is likely eliminating many people’s “safe foods,” leaving them with nothing to eat. Here’s a common one: a person with a service dog is making it unsafe for a person with a life-threatening dog allergy to be in that same space.\n\nWhose disability is more important?\n\nThat’s an impossible question to answer, and while we can and should do the best we can, there are no perfect solutions.",

      "selftext": "I’m sharing my massive 'stupid tax' so none of you make this mistake when opening your location.\n\nI was getting a custom exterior sign made. I got the quote and, being the budget-conscious small business owner I am, I decided to cut the soft costs.\n\nThe manufacturer’s itemized quote was:\n\n* **Custom Sign Fabrication (with free delivery):** $3,000\n* **Permit Filing &amp; Management:** $900\n* **Nationwide Installation &amp; Project Management:** $1,800\n* **Total Quote:** $5,700\n\n**The Reality was a Disaster:**\n\n1. **I Ordered First:** The beautiful $3,000 sign was made and shipped.\n2. **The Permit Rejection:** I took a day off to file the permit. The city rejected it instantly. They had a hyper-specific height and distance code for the type of sign I chose that I completely missed. The sign was illegal.\n3. **The True 'DIY' Cost:** I had to pay the original manufacturer another **$4,000** to completely tear down, re-fabricate a smaller sign, and expedite the new process. This was on top of the original $3,000 I already spent.\n\n**The Final Bill:** My $3,000 sign ended up costing me $7,000 (plus a 6-week delay to my grand opening).\n\n  \n**THE LESSON I WISH I'D LEARNED:**\n\n* The fabrication cost is the *least* complicated part. The $2,700 for the permit and install management was cheap insurance.\n* **That money isn't just for labor; it’s for expertise.** A national provider knows the thousands of different local codes across the U.S. and designs the sign to meet your permit requirements *before* production even starts.\n\nIf you are buying anything custom that needs city approval, **pay the full-service fee.** It’s the easiest $2,700 you'll ever spend. Learn from my mistake!\n\nWhat other hidden costs or required permits did you guys accidentally skip that came back to haunt you?\"",

          "body": "I’ve been in the sign business for over 20 years, and permitting has always been one of the most challenging parts of the process. Most sign companies, when applying for a permit on behalf of the customer, won’t begin production until the permit is officially approved. Even with plenty of experience navigating local regulations, I’ve still run into situations where a permit gets denied because of some strange interpretation of the rules by someone in the permitting office. Even when the permit office is mistaken, it can take weeks or months to get things sorted out. I've even had some customers who had to hire a lawyer to sue the town over how they interpret the rules.  I know of two towns with nearly identical sign codes that interpret and enforce them completely differently. In one town, the permit office won’t approve a sign permit until every other required permit is approved first. So even for those of us who deal with sign permitting regularly, the process can still be confusing.",

Another marketing firm claiming they have “thousands of clients,” yet they couldn’t offer any kind of guarantee. Then came the usual AI-driven pitch.\n\nIf I ever work with a marketing company, I want someone who actually takes the time to understand my business,  not one that runs an assembly line of generic, copy-paste campaigns. I told them to remove me from their call list. Honestly, if they really have thousands of clients, why are they still chasing me down?\n\nIt feels like a lot of these companies are just cash-grabbing now that AI has made things so easy. But those middleman businesses are going to be the first to suffer. I handle all my marketing myself with the help of AI, that way, I keep full control of my brand and can personalize every campaign with ease.\n\nThe moment you ask them, “So how much is this going to cost?” they hit you with, “Well, you’ll notice the difference, it’ll be worth it.” Yeah, okay buddy… go cash grab somewhere else.",

      "selftext": "**Edit:** this has been a good vent session for me. Maybe I need to lurk less, post more. Venting to friends/family isn't the same. Venting to folks in my industry isn't the same.  \n  \n**Original post:** My business has solid 7 figure revenue. Profitable. Niche service/product. Little to no competition. I have tried many ways to delegate and remove myself from day to day front of the line, but it's become clear after many years of doing this and trying to delegate, that the secret sauce is me, which can't be delegated/scaled, regardless of what various business \"experts\" will claim.\n\nI guess I feel this is a bit like telling some awesome musician that they need to teach others to do what they can do so that they can take time away. Won't work. They are the secret sauce. Without them, their band/offering is not close to what it is with them.\n\nMy business sells something that is not sold and done (like a pizza, you sell it, someone eats it, and then they don't come back a year later asking for tips on how to eat their pizza). My business sells something that can literally have years of ongoing support and hand holding. The latter part is really what is sucking the soul out of me. To use the pizza example, it seems so wonderful to be able to sell something like a pizza, or a tee shirt, or a service that you complete, and then are very unlikely to hear back from a customer again unless they want to spend more money with you. It leaves space for growth, since growth doesn't essentially mean you are compounding the chance that someone comes back to you years after they purchased from you with something they need assistance with.\n\nIt is slowly but surely sucking my soul out of me to be tied to something like this. My employees are paid well. I am paid well. The business is doing fine by all financial metrics, but every single day I want to run away from it and hide. I dread the thing that used to be fun.\n\nI often envy folks who get to clock in and clock out and forget about work when they are not there. I used to have that life. I didn't like it at the time, but in hindsight, I realize how much brain-space it freed to enjoy life and hobbies outside of work. I DO enjoy the flexibility I have from running my own business, however.\n\nThe only thing really keeping me in my biz anymore is my employees and not wanting to abandon them.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, I will be fine if the business is shut down. I will find something else if needed. I live a life with very low cash requirements and have good savings. Money isn't a huge concern of mine. The main concern is mostly my employees. If I never hired employees, this would have been shut down long ago. In that sense, I regret every hiring employees when I was dumb and people told me I had to grow.\n\nI am not looking for solutions such as \"make some processes\" or \"train someone to do what you do\". I am looking for some commiserating, specifically stories of folks who may have been in a situation like me, and decided to throw in the towel in order to regain their sanity. How has it been? Do you regret it? Did you ever get back into it later?\n\nI guess I could just grab some $$ out of the business and tell my employees it is their show now and I am done paying myself so its up to them to keep the lights on? Figure it out...",

Most of the time, I find the only thing they're an expert at is extracting real money for vague promises. Trading cash for buzzwords if you will.\n\nFor example, my ex had a cousin who was a professor at a pretty renowned business school. By all accounts an \"expert\"....on paper. But the thing is, she had never spent a day in her life actually practicing what she preached. She went right from undergrad to a doctoral program, and when she earned that, went right back into academia, as a professor. So now she's teaching business without ever having been in business.\n\nI always tell this story because to me it's such a great example of how \"knowledge authority\" works today. i.e. what looks good on paper often doesn't translate to the real world all that well. Like, who would you rather take advice from...a grungy plumber who has trouble forming complete sentences but who built an 8-figure operation from scratch? Or, a polished MBA professor with all kinds of letters after his name but who's never signed a check in his life?",

I get stressed out about friends of mine who may be at risk of a layoff or becoming obsolete because of new technology. \n\n  \nbut yes, running a business can be stressful and some people internatize things where others don't. I have stress in my job...but I learned how to kinda 'turn it off'. Some people can't. \n\n  \nA buddy of mine who owns an electrical contracting company kind of explained running a business in a way that I think makes sense. He views it as a train where you have to keep it moving and always finding new fuel to keep it running...it is about keeping that train moving. Ironically this buddy of mine used to have 30 employees....and was always stressed out. Now he has a half a dozen and much happier because it takes less fuel to keep things running(and he is still making good money)\n\n  \nwhat's funny is while I've learned to have less stress about my own business...i probably worry too much about others...i remember a friend of mine being fired and I lost more sleep about it than he did.
