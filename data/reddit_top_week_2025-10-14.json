      "selftext": "So I started a lawn care business a little over a month ago (proof on my post history) and ended up scoring 25 clients in one month from leaving door hangers \n\nI worked on a realtors lawn and she was complaining to me about how people park in her 5 acre lot without permission during a very popular event in my city during October. And she offered me $50 to drive there, dig a hole and leave a sign that said “private property, no trespassing, property is under surveillance 24/7” so I can tell she REALLY didn’t want people on her property. \n\nSo instead of accepting the job I offered her to manage the parking lot and charge people for parking and we can split the money. We agreed on 50/50.\n\nFast forward a few days ago , I paid for a few signs and printed pages saying “parking $10” which only costed me a few bucks. \n\nWent there at 1pm and started charging people $10 each for parking. I made $5 for every car that passed \n\nAfter 4 hours charging people non stop I made a total of $4,700 in just parking fees, minus $100 in set up costs. $4,600 profit split between the property owner and took myself $2,300 home today. I am going to do this for 3 more Saturday’s to pull in some serious dough.\n\nGonna use my profit to buy a nice truck cash for my lawn care business. \n\nOpportunities are out there, is there a chance that you’re going to do the exact same thing I did and replicate my success? Most likely not but what does help is having the mind of a hustler and noticing dollar bills when people are in pain. ",

You would print ads in their fur so they go around town showing it off. The money would helo paying for sterilization and other vet bills for them. \n\n \n- lazy food brand - food for people too lazy to prepare it. Cookies already pre-socked in milk; nachos pre-covered in guacamole, pre-sliced oranges, etc\n\n \n- make religious “p0rn” movies - an electrician that enters a client’s house barefoot with a power drill in hand to fix a tv, while the client is a pretty woman in only a bath robe (like most movies of the kind), but the plot twist is that he really just fixes the tv, they pray together a few minutes and part their ways, no funny business.\n\n \n- tinder app for elderly people. Instead of the current tinder like/dislike mechanic, in works like uber and just connects them to the nearest available option.\n\n \n- poop gamification. A smart toilet where you login each time and compete with friends to see who poops the most in a week, or the heaviest. In my head and with the right skills, you could maybe even play poop battleship with friends\n\n \n- brown emergency lights (like the blue ones police attached to cars roofs in the movies) for when you need to get home fast to poop\n\n \n\nPs: I usually get my ideas at night when I suffer from insomnia, so some might be a bit delusional.. imagine the fun I had reading them in the morning though :)\n \n\nPS2: if any of you can get any of these ideas working, update me, I’d love to see it ahah",

People make bad decisions when the are desperate.  I suggest getting more curious.\n\nSTOP CHASING THE OPPORTUNITIES JUST FOR THE MONEY:   In 2010 a food plant I worked at closed its doors.  I know a guy who wanted to go into nursing because of the money.   He had worked at that plant from the day he graduated from high school until it closed.   So rushing into any business idea without out studying it first will guarantee failure.   Pet sitting for example might sound great however there are downsides to everything.   Animal's personalities are as varied as humans.   I grew up on farm with horses, cows, a pig, chickens,  dogs and cats.  \n\nSELF - EVALUATION:   What skills do you have including hobbies?  Write them down.   Take a few days to really think about them.    Also write down your weakness.    Is there opportunities there?    \n\nOPPORTUNITY EVALUATIONS  Do you need any licenses or insurance to operate?    For example, what happens if a pet dies or attacks a neighbor while under your care?  What is your Liability?    Do you see or have you heard about a possible opportunity that isn't being fulfilled already?    \n\nMost  get the cart before the horse.   In their thinking -  I need money so what can I do to get money.    Where a better way is to look in your area or world wide,  is there a niche I can fill that people will pay me for.   In the book Side Hustle that is what the people in the book did.  \n\nGET EDUCATED:   Learn accounting,  management skills,  communication skills, and whatever skills you are going to need to do the side hustle.   Learn content creation -  blogs and video  especially.   Content Creators  if the production is good can make good money. \n\nWhatever you start, think about scale ability.    Starting out you will have to keep your job.   At some point you might want to go full time as a business.  \n\nJust my two cents worth.  LOL",

AI can tell the story if you must, but it cannot do the creative side! \n\nThe second skill is creating an ebook cover. You’ll need a simple Canva or Photoshop tutorial for that.\n\nThe third (it’s not marketing) is meta. You must know how to publish correctly. This is tags, keywords, the story description itself, etc. \n\nIf you can do all three, great, you have the potential of $1k/mo+ minimum if you give this hell. I see a lot of amateurs make a lot of money in here, but that’s not really what it’s about. That’s the 1% doing full time, etc.\n\nYou’d likely start and put in an average of an hour a day. That would come out to an ebook going live maybe 2-3x a week, even more once you have the system down. \n\nDouble down on wins, let the losses go and learn what does and does not sell. As you get better with the above skills, you’ll make more. And, sales from stories layer.\n\nWhen you stop publishing, maybe 20% sales will stay, passive, continuing to sell. I’m over a decade in now and haven’t published to my catalog yet this year. \n\nMy recommendation is to first learn, then second try. Do not try first. This is nsfw art and there are rules and regulations. There are no three strikes because if you mess up, you’re likely done with that platform.\n\nAnyways, if you’d like to know more, you’re welcome to check out my profile. I have a discord server with info and some tips, and a critique area for stories and cover art. You can also advertise your new stories to my core audience of smut buyers and readers. Lots of new authors hanging out, and elder authors like myself as well.\n\nThis year helping new authors get going has been wild. It has spawned even a new ebook store I created. Being in the biz so long and a web dev, I couldn’t help but fill in what I see wrong with the industry. It’s not a lot of money, but so far there’s a handful of authors making grocery money at least!\n\nRighto, it is now very late and I am to bed. Welcome to check out my profile, join discord, read the how to, hang with the community and ask questions. We all love to share our sales, so there is a dedicated spot for everyone to throw up their monthly sales. 😀",

My paychecks now are usually $550-$650 every 2 weeks, but this will decrease immensely for those few months of being busy with school. \n\nWhat are some ways that I can make $200-$400 or more extra a month (Already do DoorDash, but even then I won’t have much time to do that next semester)?  \n\nEdit: I appreciate all replies , though I’d like to mention I prefer non-AI related ideas.

      "selftext": "I used to treat tools like toys, fun to play with, but not serious. I’d mess around for a bit, close the tab, move on. But somehow, a few of those random things ended up quietly making me money.\n\nHeyEtsy was one of the first. I only even bothered opening it because someone mentioned it in some random Reddit thread. This thing actually shows you what's really selling, not just what's, like, all over your feed. I started using it to just peek at the real numbers before I wasted another 10 hours designing totally random crap. That tiny shift literally saved me from launching a dozen flops.\n\nThen came CheckEtsy basically, it tells you which keywords actually convert. Not “trending,” not “hyped,” but selling. That’s how one of my listings accidentally became my top earner. Not because I was smart, I just followed the data for once.\n\nIdeogram and Midjourney completely blew my mind, too. Instead of literally slaving away for hours designing from scratch, I could just pump out a bunch of concepts in minutes, pick the decent ones, and quickly clean them up. It wasn’t even about 'AI magic,' really, it was just about pure speed - getting to the next idea way faster.\n\nAnd this one still kinda trips me out: some random little Google indexing tool I stumbled upon online. It basically made my pages show up on search way, way faster. Nothing fancy, at all, but it was like a secret shield, making sure all the stuff I'd already bothered building didn't just vanish into the internet abyss.\n\nNone of these tools made me rich, obviously. But man, together they just shaved off all the soul-crushing, boring parts and let me actually focus on the fun stuff. They basically kept my side hustle chugging along while I was busy pretending to take breaks.\n\nWhat’s the one tool that ended up helping you more than you expected?\n\n",

I killed everything, every campaign, every “plan.” I figured if nothing worked anyway, at least I’d stop setting my cash on fire. So I started posting whatever felt easy: some random designs on Etsy, a few half-finished ideas sitting on my laptop, nothing special.\n\nThen one of them sold. A tiny order, but man, it felt way bigger than it was. I threw up a few more listings, and somehow the ones I barely touched started selling more than the ones I’d spent hours on.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I'd made a few pins like, ages ago, never even bothered to optimize them, literally completely forgot they existed. Months later, I just randomly peeked out of curiosity and saw they were still sending people to my shop. Legit free eyeballs, somehow. Blew my mind.\n\nPinterest was another absolute fluke. I posted a couple quick pieces about what I was learning, didn’t push them anywhere, but they just kept popping up again and again. Each time they did, a few bucks showed up in my account like pocket change from nowhere.\n\nThen the whole AI craze hit. I tried a couple tools to remix trending designs into my own style. They made everything look fresh again and, I swear to god, they weirdly out-sold my 'perfect' versions that I'd slaved over for days. Go figure.\n\nNone of this made me rich, don't get me wrong. It just stacked up, a sale here, a few bucks there, until 'no ads' didn't mean 'no money.'

Then all of a sudden, it goes right back to being good, 50 orders in a day kind of days. \n\nIt ebbs and flows and you just gotta take it in stride. If a design isn’t selling, just give it a few months. Renew it, automatically renew it, it’s only 20 cents to. So why not?\n\nThanks for this OP. Giving me motivation again for my own shop",

I have a lot of free time at work, was wondering if there is something like filling out surveys or anything that may need labor. Rent went up not by much but just enough to start effecting my savings by a concerning rate if I did my math correctly. Would like to get a second job but none are willing to work with my schedule that are in my area. Any ideas would greatly be appreciated. ",

      "selftext": "I’ve been digging into what it really takes to turn a blog into a money maker in 2025, and one thing keeps coming up is consistency. If you publish only once in a while, you’ll never build enough momentum for search engines or readers to trust you. It is the bloggers who post weekly or more tend that scale much faster when it comes to traffic. Over time, that regular output compounds into more keywords, internal links, and authority, which are all essential for real income growth.\n\nMonetization usually starts with ads and affiliate links. A good benchmark is RPM, which means revenue per 1,000 pageviews. Currently, I have monetized my blog with Google Ad sense and the RPM usually hovers around $10-15. \n\nLooking at more successful blogs, many now report around $20 to $30 RPM on average across combined ad and affiliate income. For example, 20,000 monthly pageviews at a $25 RPM equals about $500 per month. \n\nOnce you meet traffic thresholds, you can also apply for premium ad networks, which often pays $12 to $30 or more per thousand views. AdSense and similar networks pay differently by region, with traffic from the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. earning much higher rates. As your blog grows, you can add digital products, sponsored posts, or courses. Blogs with multiple income streams can reach $50 to $100 RPM or higher.\n\nThe potential is real. But you need consistent posting, good SEO, and the patience to build authority. If you’re starting or trying to grow a blog this year, focus on steady publishing, optimizing for high-value countries, and gradually improving your monetization setup.\n\nIf you have any questions about monetization and the likes, let me know.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI graduated about 4 months ago, and since then, I’ve been trying to land a job, but it’s been tough. With the whole AI boom happening, it feels like no one’s giving fresh grads a chance. I’ve applied to a ton of jobs, but either I don’t hear back at all, or I’m just not shortlisted. I’ve also tried some data annotation gigs and other side jobs, but honestly, the pay is so low, and the work doesn’t seem worth it. I’m tired of grinding through apps and microtasks that barely pay anything, and I just need something that feels like it respects the effort I’m putting in.\n\nI’m looking for a remote side hustle that pays decently and allows me to put in the work without getting burned out. I’m open to learning new things and willing to put in the time, but I just need something that values my time and effort and actually provides a reasonable return. I’m not looking for something that requires years of experience, but I do want something where I can develop skills and get paid fairly. If anyone has any legit side hustles, remote gigs, or freelance work that they think might be a good fit, I’d really appreciate any suggestions!\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Find products your audience already talks about or asks for and drop Amazon Associates or ShareASale links. If your pages are niche-specific even better - reach out to brands directly for commission deals.\n\nDigital products take time to create but if you know your audience well it's worth it. Even something simple like a $7-15 PDF guide or checklist can add up when you're hitting 100K+ impressions monthly. Test it small before investing too much time.\n\nThe Facebook invite thing is a black box honestly. I wouldn't count on it happening soon. Focus on what you can control right now.",

It started as a joke, but I figured if it was weird and specific enough, people might actually use it. I added meal tracking, a “stinkiest day” insight, and some affiliate links for gut health stuff just to see what would happen. Now there are over 1,600 farts logged from 60 countries… and today I made my first $1. It’s not much, but that was the goal. Just make one dollar from something I built. Feels kinda surreal.\n\nNext goal: $1,000.",

Last 4 months  $103.47 (RPM \\~$2.1). \\~5-6 hrs/wk filming/editing.\n* Turo (2022 Prius): 9 days booked last 3 months, gross $358 → after Turo fee/insurance/cleaning, net $237; minus a $35 tire patch = $202 take-home. Spent \\~25 minutes scrubbing a stale coffee smell out of the Prius before a pickup - renter no-showed anyway.\n* Task monkey (chrome extension) - funny enough, I tried it on Amazon October Prime Day last week and it got me like $138 back from price drop. Probably the only thing I'd call \"passive income.\"no link/ not affiliated.\n\nHalf a year in, I don't buy the \"work hard and it’ll click\" thing anymore. Most of this stuff is the same tricks with a new label. You put in hours, spend a little cash, and it stalls out. The only money I saw was small and hands-on. Not passive - just extra shifts on a different screen. If you've got something that really pays without babysitting, I'm listening.",

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

Cold coffee, messy sheets, and half-finished side stuff I forget even exists.\n\nPinterest was the first surprise. A few years back I threw up some random designs pointing at a tiny site I had. Then I moved on. Months later I peeked just out of boredom and saw those same pins still sending people my way. I hadn’t logged in forever. Felt like finding cash in old jeans, but online.\n\nMedium did the same thing. I tossed a couple posts about what I was messing with on Etsy, nothing polished, didn’t share them anywhere. They somehow kept getting read. Every few weeks I’d get a tiny “you got paid” ping and just laugh.\n\nEtsy kept doing its own thing too. Some listings with reviews kept selling. Even old trend stuff I swore was dead still sold a few here and there. Phone goes cha-ching while I’m half-asleep, still one of my favorite sounds ever.\n\nAnd the nerdy bit: I figured out a way to get my old pages showing up on Google again faster. Nothing fancy, just me tinkering too much. But it worked. That slow drip of visitors never really stopped.\n\nNone of this was planned. I messed around, forgot half of it, and somehow some of it stuck. Tiny, low effort, kinda messy but it keeps paying for caffeine, and that’s good enough for me.",

I studied abroad for 6 long years. The first few years were fine — textbooks, exams, good grades. But everything changed when we started working with real patients.\n\nThe first surgery I witnessed, I fainted. I couldn’t handle the blood, the pain, the reality. In the ER, I saw my first patient die during CPR, and I broke down crying. They thought I was a family member. That’s when I realized — I’m not built for this. But after five years, it felt too late to quit.\n\nNow I’ve graduated, and my parents — who’ve sacrificed everything for me — keep saying how I’ll finally make things better for the family. My dad is even planning to retire once I start residency. But the truth is… I can’t do it. I can’t be a doctor.\n\nWe’re struggling financially, I’m the oldest of many siblings, and the pressure is unbearable. I’ve tried applying for other jobs, but they either aren’t in my major so won’t accept me, or they need experience I don’t have — and the few that do hire pay so little it would barely cover my transportation.\n\nI speak five languages, I’m outgoing, good at sales, social media, and editing — but I feel trapped between guilt and fear. My family’s counting on me, but I don’t even know who I am anymore.\n\nIf anyone knows where or how I could start a new job or find a different path, please… I’d really appreciate any advice or direction. I just want to start somewhere.",

One of the doctors onsight had this same issue, now he works here and doesn’t work with a single patient. Also, you could be a family Dr? At a local clinic for the most part you just read a chart, double check the patient and sign off on some meds. No crazy emergency situations there. Also, back to the public health, we have another doctor that exclusively works with our EMS department on planning and organizing. Some places in the county just need a doctor on site and they dont have to actually do anything. You also might be able to teach at a JC or one of those schools that do the fast track programs.

You may even be able to contract with several companies and combined income to make more to catch your family up.\n\nYou can also look into Research  and development jobs. There is companies that are developing medical AI. I even worked with a Doctor who worked for a healthcare company strategizing on plans for patients, but didn’t actively see any because he also decided it wasn’t for him. You could also look to be the director of a facility without being hands-on, such as a PACE facility. \n\nYour knowledge base is valuable for any number of healthcare companies or insurance companies for that matter, they need a doctor to review procedures and approvals. \n\nThink outside the box because you don’t want your career to go to waste. \n\nInterestingly, enough, my dermatologist is an internal medicine doctor. He much like you did not want to do traditional medicine after all that schooling so he now does lasers and injections and has a good time staying with people who are coming in to get things done cosmetically. He has a good practice going and makes a really good salary equivalent to what he be making in the field he went to school for.\n\nNot having experience yet shouldn’t be a dealbreaker, because you do have experience -it’s just how you frame it as you’re starting off.  At one of my former companies, we hired people less than a year out of medical school for good jobs. Granted they were from the Ivys so that probably made a difference but simply think of ways to convert your résumé that would appeal to whatever job you’re thinking of. \n\nFor example, you could put on there the volume of patients you saw in residency and how many cases you’re responsible for, you can talk about how many reports and administrative items you successfully completed.\n\nJust as an example, you can say something like, “ successfully monitored 30 patients a day in a 2000 bed facility while reviewing 150 medical reports a week”. \n\nGood luck let us know what you decide.",

They sort of see you as an extension of themselves. Nothing wrong with wanting to please your parents. However, you are an individual in your own right.\n\nYou said your dad wants to retire soon but you can’t be a doctor. Is your dad expecting you to help support the family with your doctor degree after he retires? If so, I am not sure that is fair. Yes he did give you everything to get to your doctor degree but he needs to let you build your own life.\n\nMany posted here telling you how you have so many options that you can do with your degree that do not involve seeing patients or blood. I would consider those options.\n\nHowever, I think you need to also consider doing something that YOU choose to do. Even if not as a full time career. Do you have any hobbies? Try to find something YOU are interested and make a goal to create something of it: whether it be developing a hobby to enjoy on the side or even turning it into a part time or full time business. You can start this slowly as a side thing while you are working as a doctor. \n\nBy doing something that YOU decided to do you will start to develop a sense of self that is not an extension of your parents and will gain the confidence you seek in anything you do.\n\nI can relate to your situation because I was in a similar situation as you. \n\nGive yourself time to grow. Life can be hard at times but it will get better.

I saw my first patient die during CPR…. Bollocks story!!!\nI never went to Med school, but I remember when I was in Uni, the stories I heard (probably year 2) med students fainting when shown cadavers? I know there is something called student doctors, in essence, these doctors have not graduated, but are in the real world getting real world practical knowledge? How could you have graduated medical school without encountering blood many times, dead bodies, dying patients, sick to the stomach patients etc. \nSimple logic tells me no medical course or curriculum will not ensure, psychological, mental, emotional etc effects of the every day trauma that a medical doctor will face in the real world? You would have been prepared for worse, during your training or schooling? They must have exposed you  to these physical realities by ensuring you physically engaged in them numerous times to be used to them.\nUnfortunately, I don’t believe the story",

I feel like the difference is that we can keep composure in the moment and do our jobs. As long as we don’t panic, let our emotions give us tunnel vision so we can’t do our jobs or perform CPR properly, it’s ok to cry at the end of it. I’ll do a 5 hour case, be ok during the case and do my job but at the end when it’s all done and I process things is when the tears come. I see a lot of death and it is hard. But crying, making others around us remember that these are people loved with families is what makes us human and connects us to our patients.\n\nWith that being said, sometimes it’s just not our thing and that’s ok too. I grew up loving medicine since I was a little kid and I still don’t know if this is the right place for me. You might grow to love it or find something you love a ton more.",

Most things that actually work in 2025 aren’t passive at the start, they’re front loaded. You put in focused work upfront, build the system once, then let it earn for you over time. For me, that looked like learning how to package what I already knew and was already doing for others into simple digital products and automating the delivery + marketing side of it. It didn’t happen overnight, but after the setup, the results started compounding quietly in the background.\nIf you’re stretched thin right now, don’t chase income streams build one smart system that can eventually buy your time back.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you!

      "selftext": "Before you downvote, hear me out. I know this sub generally views gambling negatively, but I wanted to share some hard-learned lessons about risk management that actually apply to any form of investing or speculation.\n\nBackground: I'm a software engineer who got into sports betting during COVID. What started as $100 bets quickly escalated, and I ended up wagering about $50k over the course of 2023. I'm up about $3,200 overall, but the real value was learning proper bankroll management principles.\n\nThe Kelly Criterion in Practice: The most important thing I learned was position sizing. In sports betting, there's something called the Kelly Criterion that determines optimal bet size based on your edge and the odds. The formula is:\n\nf = (bp - q) / b\n\nWhere:\n\nf = fraction of bankroll to bet\n\nb = odds received (decimal odds - 1)\n\np = probability of winning\n\nq = probability of losing (1 - p)\n\nReal Example: If I think a team has a 55% chance of winning, but the book is offering +100 odds (50% implied probability), the Kelly formula suggests betting about 10% of my bankroll. Most people would bet way more because \"it's a sure thing.\"\n\nWhat This Taught Me About Regular Investing:\n\n1. Position Sizing Matters More Than Pick Quality Even if you're right 60% of the time, betting too much on any single outcome will eventually ruin you. This applies directly to stock picking or crypto investments.\n\n2. Emotional Control is Everything After a big win, I wanted to bet more. After losses, I wanted to \"chase\" to get even. Sound familiar to anyone who's panic-sold stocks or FOMO'd into crypto?\n\n3. Diversification Isn't Just About Different Assets I learned to spread bets across different sports, bet types, and time periods. The same way you shouldn't put everything in tech stocks, you shouldn't put everything on \"sure thing\" bets.\n\n4. Track Everything I kept detailed records of every bet - amount, reasoning, outcome. This showed me I was actually terrible at NFL betting but good at tennis. Most people don't track their investment performance this granularly.\n\nThe Practical Takeaway: Whether you're buying individual stocks, crypto, or yes, even sports betting, the math of risk management is the same. The Kelly Criterion can help determine position sizes for any investment where you think you have an edge.\n\nTools I Use: For anyone curious, I primarily use bet105 now because their reduced juice (-105 vs standard -110) significantly improves long-term returns. It's like finding an index fund with a 0.1% expense ratio vs 0.5% - small differences compound over time.\n\nThe Bottom Line: I'm not advocating for sports betting as an investment strategy. But the risk management principles I learned apply to everything from stock picking to starting a business. Sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected places.

Me and my friend we have been learning different strategies for the past 5  years and we’re finally getting to a place where we’re making progress. \n\nOur profit margins are growing! We can make about $2,000 in a good week. \n\nI also trade crypto currencies with this same strategy. \nI haven’t lost more than I’ve gained since I’ve learned about this winning strategy but I did run into some issues with my family that I had to take care of. \n\nNow I’m starting to get this account built back up.\n\nIf you’re interested, let me know.",

      "selftext": "I didn’t hit $10k in a month. Honestly, it took me almost 2 months just to land my first $500 client.\n\nBut over the next year, I grew it into $15k in total revenue. Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n1. Start ugly, sell fast.\nMy first site looked like it came from a $20 template. But it solved the client’s problem (they just needed something live for a campaign). Don’t overthink polish in the beginning.\n\n2. Cold outreach &gt; waiting.\nAt first, I kept posting “looking for clients” ads and got nothing. What finally worked was sending personalized DMs/emails. I’d literally pick a small business, redesign a section of their homepage, and send it with a note: “This is how your site could look.”\n\n3. Use the right stack.\nI started with Framer templates, sometimes even Lovable. Later I hacked faster by combining an open-source starter (Frameable) with AI coding (Claude/ChatGPT). That mix let me deliver quickly without getting stuck when clients wanted small custom changes.\n\n4. Raise prices early.\nI was charging $300–500 for weeks of work. Dumb. Once I had a few sites in my portfolio, I started quoting $1,200+. Fewer clients, better margins, less burnout.\n\n\t\n5. Referrals snowball.\nMy first 3 clients all came from outreach. But by the time I had 6–7, new ones started showing up through word of mouth. That’s when things got way easier.\n\nI’m not claiming guru status. I just kept iterating until something clicked.",

That’s not how it works.\n\nPassive income isn’t some magic loophole that prints cash. It’s the reward for front-loading the hard work putting in the effort *now* so you don’t have to later. Every person who’s built something that earns passively has paid in *either time, money, or both.*\n\nIf you’re starting from $0, that’s fine but be ready to grind. Learn copywriting, create digital products, start a YouTube channel, build a blog, anything. But if your plan is to do nothing and somehow earn something, you’re better off buying a lottery ticket.\n\nPeople love the idea of “passive income” because it sounds effortless. But in reality, it’s just *delayed effort.*\n\n  \nIs there *any* way to start truly passive income from $0 without investing a single hour or dollar? Or is that just a fantasy that social media keeps selling us?",

In case you are equipped with a smartphone and internet, this is actually the right time to start, provided you are smart about it.\n\nStart learning skills that combine human creativity with AI tools. As an illustration, use ChatGPT or Claude to learn quires like copywriting, marketing, or scriptwriting. Practically you can do everything for free. After that, you can use applications such as CapCut or Canva to create content for small creators or local businesses. You can offer to edit their short videos, write captions, or come up with ideas, all from your phone.\n\nAI is not only taking away jobs but also creating new ones for those who understand it. The majority of creators do not have time to learn these tools, you can be the one who makes it easier for them. Discard the \"get rich quick\" apps, acquire a real skill with AI and use that to buy your first computer. That is how you get out for good.",

          "body": "Building $3,000 per month in passive income will take time, but it’s absolutely doable if you focus on the right systems and lean into your strengths.\n\nGiven your experience in IT, Agile, and coaching, one of the best places to start is creating and selling digital products based on your knowledge. That could be templates for project planning, Agile sprint boards, training slide decks, or even Notion or Airtable setups for productivity. You can sell these on Gumroad or Etsy. Once created, these digital products can generate income over time without ongoing work.\n\nYou could also consider launching a small online course or coaching bundle. You don’t need a big production or a huge audience. Even a short workshop or a focused email course can be sold on platforms like Gumroad or Teachable. With your background, people will pay to learn how to manage projects, navigate Scrum roles, or improve productivity in their own teams.\n\nAffiliate marketing is another path worth exploring. You can earn when someone buys through your link, and this works well when you’re recommending tools you genuinely use or believe in. The key is to learn how to make persuasive content, whether through blog posts, short videos, or email guides, that helps people make a buying decision. I walk through how to do this step by step in my newsletter if you’re interested.\n\nGiven your love for cooking and healthy living, you could also create a faceless YouTube channel, digital cookbook, or a healthy meal planner. These kinds of content can be monetized through ads, affiliate links, and digital product sales. It’s not instant, but over time, it can grow into a reliable income stream.\n\nPrint-on-demand could also complement your creative interests. You can design wellness-themed journals, recipe logs, or even merch with positive messages and sell them on platforms like Printful through Etsy.\n\nYou already have the discipline, knowledge, and mindset. Now it’s just a matter of choosing one or two paths and going deep instead of wide. I break down each of these ideas with examples and tutorials in my newsletter. Feel free to check it out, the link is in my bio.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Most of them are just selling guides or courses, and *that's* how they make their money not from the methods they’re advertising. They prey on people hoping for easy cash, selling info that should honestly be free.\n\nThe truth is, people who are actually making money don’t usually need to prove it, because they’re not trying to sell you anything. I’ve personally been making money through affiliate marketing for the past 18 years. It *does* work, but it’s not instant, and it definitely takes effort to learn and grow. That’s usually where people give up right at the beginning when it feels hard or slow.\n\nBottom line: **Effort = Results.** If you’re serious about it and want to talk more, feel free to DM me.

I have a lot of free time and tried everything I could online to turn minutes into dollars, this is the best thing I've found thats worth your time!\n\nWhen companies create / alter product lines.. they want to get a feel for how to general market will enjoy/dislike the product. Companies pay people to test out the product / software / phone app / websites / commercials etc basically everything out there before it hits the market.\n\nI make around $300-1000 a month performing market research. It can sometimes be very specific, for new accounting software they want an actual accountants feedback obviously. Filling out the questionnaires is tedious and my success rate is around 1-2 / 10 sign ups, but when you get approved it is well worth it.\n\nI wrote about it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1ewda9j/market_research_strategy_explained/\n\nI've gotten very good feedback from people who have hours to kill during work or are at home often. I usually aim for the higher value sessions $150+ and try to complete 5 of them.\n\nThe best once Ive gotten was a one day 8 hour session for new food products, this was an in-person one but 95% can be done online with a smartphone or laptop, sometimes needing a webcam.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, I picked this up during the pandemic and over 5.5 years I've made over $25,000 across various websites.\n\nNote: This requires actual effort so the more time you put in the more successful you are.\n\nBONUS\n\nYou can easily make $10 a day on attapoll, I do it during my spare time at work to add to my hourly income.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1jzd0ow/making_10_a_day_online/",

Everything seemed real but also very...off? The whole interview was on Microsoft Teams, typed not voice(red flag 1), but it lasted about an hour. They asked me a bunch of questions (most of not all would have been on the application) and sent them to be reviewed. I was asked to stay only for  5 - 10 minutes.\nThen not 5 minutes later I get a message from them telling me I was hired?(Red flag 2)\n\nSo does anyone know anything about them or is this just a giant scam? I can post screenshots of the interview if anyone wants?(With my information blurred of course)\n\nPlease and thank you",

I just looked up their reviews on Trustpilot, and something seems off about them. All of the mostly 5-star reviews are written the same way but with different details: the name of the surgeon, how the staff promptly responded to queries, and how the patient felt so comfortable. Nearly every review follows the same formula.\n\nFurther, knowing the spelling and grammar ability of the average Brit, these reviews are too well written.\n\nThey obviously give patients the text to use as the review. \n\nI searched the big jobs sites and didn't see any remote jobs for Medbelle, only hybrid roles in Berlin.

When I could finally login, my task queue was completely empty, as well as my job history/applied jobs etc. I can't even edit my payment or job information. \n\nIs someone else experimenting this? I've tried to fix the problem by clearing my cookies and such, but I can't simply log in to work on my task queue. I am a little baffled because the communication with my project team has been really good, and I haven't received any offboarding email...

Moreover, it is becoming an important topic as more marketers are making the transition to affiliate marketing.\n\nHi everyone — short story: I’ve been in e-commerce for 8 years in my own businesses + former agency (video editing, copy, design, built my own sites + custom landing pages, ran Meta, Google &amp; TikTok ads, shots with influencers etc). This year I lost my business after the Meta update (not going into more details here), so I’m pivoting to affiliate full-time — but organically.\n\nGoal: $2–3k / month as my first milestone. No paid ads for now.\nI know that the main job of the affiliate is to drive traffic and that comes thrugh mainly this:\n-&gt; providing value on great content, creating a community and finding good offers (ideally subscription based OR high ticket) , right?\n\nI’m thinking of: mix of faceless + on-camera (reviews, short explainers, case studies), owning landing pages + email funnel. I can code pages, make creatives, and edit like hell — but I need the strategy and the fastest path to those first reliable commissions.\n\nBasically, it would be a great help for me if a PRO affiliate would take a few minutes and briefly lay out his approach.\n\nSo I want to ask you: what strategy would you take if you were me — with these skills but zero ad budget (for now) — to hit 2–3k/month?\n\nTo make replies easier, here are the constraints &amp; \"assets\":\n\n- 8 yrs ecommerce (I know funnels &amp; analytics)\n- I can make video + long reviews + edit fast - I have some doubts about putting my face on it, but ok, if I find an offer I can really believe in, let's do it\n- I can build landing pages\n- email is not my thing - but I'll learn that fast and build magnets to increase my DB\n- I have experience 8yrs of running ads (so I can scale later) but no ad budget now — must be organic, partnerships, barter, SEO, email, Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, etc.\n- I have no channels / communities of my own, I ONLY have a 200k email list (ecommerce products, maybe I can use them for something, but most of them are age 50+)\n- Based in Romania , Europe (that's important too I guess) I can create also for local people OR for international market - another BIG questions of mine\n\nWhat I’d love from the community:\n\n* Growth paths / approaches\n* Language approaches? (local / international market?) \n* Best offer types to chase first (recurring vs one-time? high AOV vs high conversion?)\n* Any quick templates? :D (DM script, hook examples, landing layout) you’d recommend\n* If you’re offering collab/mentorship/have a product that fits ... drop a reply or DM me.\n\nIf you can share your tactic, I think there are a lot of people in my position, and i think that this sub will become one of my new best buddies haha.. Let’s build something useful for everyone :D \n\n(Yes I used chatGPT to polish my post because english is not my first language and it helped me to structure the ideas for a better understanding)",

First the numbers, though. \n\nThe site is now at 31k session for the last 30 days and has thereby grown by 5k monthly sessions since the last update. \n\nI won't reach my goal of 50k monthly sessions by the end of the year but at least it continues to grow.\n\nBut now on the exciting bit: I was accepted into Mediavine (kind of!). I made a few posts on Reddit, asking about ad networks tailored for tool sites.\n\nThe CEO of Mediavine eventually reached out and put me in touch with his team. \n\nThat said, I won't be onboarded onto Mediavine for now but one of their other ad networks, which is called PubNation (any experience with PubNation is greatly appreciated). \n\nAs the tool site continues to grow, so will hopefully my access to better ad products. \n\nI also hope that enabling ads will allow me to make more money on the [desktop app](https://www.terrific.tools/terrific-tools-desktop) since purchasing the license will also grant users an ad-free experience on the main website. \n\nMoreover, I also started releasing some improvements to the desktop app. I will go full-time on our other SaaS and the tool site by the end of the year, so hopefully can get those out more frequently. \n\nLastly, I [finally added Google authentication](https://x.com/onlinedopamine/status/1966209490727932397) to the tool site, which allowed me to double my signups in a month. Not sure if all of those are legit but at least I now have a growing email list I can tap into eventually. ",

      "selftext": "I've been searching on the web for a while, trying to find something I can do to gain financial stability to get to my dream goal of building a dog training facility.  I am 28f, with a few medical issues that I want to overcome.  I am passionate in training dogs, birds, cats, and overall love listening to others.  I truly love to people part of dog training.  I have 14 years of education in dog training, learning under multiple mentors. Many people have told me I need to write a book about my life and that I give great life advice because of what my medical conditions have put me through.  I feel a lot of people look up to me, though I strongly feel inadequate in that realm.  I want to blog about my journey to success.\n\nThe best thing is I have massive support to get through this, in the sense of, stable housing without needing to work, disability income (that I wish to work towards going off), and overall emotional support of my friends.  With that said, my goals are:\n\n* To build inspiration in others who are in my shoes or in similar situations.  Create guides on how to grow a business that works around their chronic illness(es).\n* Share my story in a book that encompasses life lessons I have learned along the way.\n* Eventually sell products (like t-shirts, buttons, patches) that bring awareness and possibly create a non-profit to help people in my shoes.\n* Start public speaking about my journey and how I conquered my medical conditions.\n* Eventually, **create my own dog training and boarding business** as that's my biggest passion (this has a huge startup cost, so I need a way to make the money)\n\nWith that said, my biggest setback is really just my medical conditions.  They are neurological, and after an injury, my brain struggles to learn information, but that's getting better.  I have struggled with the next steps after figuring out my goals, such as, what I need to learn to accomplish this and the basic steps to get started.  It all seems overwhelming, but I know once the ball gets rolling I will figure it all out.  My biggest inspiration is Temple Grandin. I am autistic and an extremely visual and hands on learner.\n\nAny advice, words of wisdom, or guidance would be much appreciated.",

      "selftext": "There's a growing split: some say 'content wins,' others quietly optimize distribution because velocity begets visibility.\n\nReceipts from the last quarter:\n\n- Field note: A fresh TikTok handle commented on 10+ mid-tier creator posts in 15 minutes, then dropped a 14s clip. Watch-time was only 36%, but profile CTR in hour one carried it to 29k views. Distribution ignition over content quality.\n\n- Thread A/B on X: Nearly identical value density; the version with 18 coordinated early replies (no links) earned 4.7x impressions and 3.1x bookmarks in 24h.\n\n- Shorts observation: Clips that acquire 15–25 high-quality comments within the first 10 minutes routinely outrun similar AVD peers without that early signal.\n\nEthics: If you believe in market-making for attention, momentum tactics are pump-priming. If you believe in pure meritocracy, they're gaming. Most operators I know sit in the messy middle, trying to seed distribution without poisoning the commons. Crescitaly appears in my world as one tool among many, but the real issue is how any tool is applied, not its existence.\n\nFrank take: Platforms reward early velocity by design. Refusing distribution design cedes reach to those who embrace it. But if everyone over-optimizes momentum, signals degrade into noise.\n\nQuestion: Should transparent, time-boxed momentum tactics be normalized in a modern playbook, or should we draw a hard line at anything beyond organic? What would a practical 2025 code of conduct look like? Push back hard.",

Creating an arms race where everyone feels compelled to disclose or risk being called out\n\n\n\nBut if you don't disclose, you're in ethical quicksand—especially if you're teaching strategy to others or selling courses on 'organic growth.'\n\n\n\nThe middle ground I've seen work: be transparent about the principles (velocity matters, early signals compound) without revealing specific tactics or scale. So you teach the why, not the exact playbook. That still feels slippery to some, though.\n\n\n\nWhat's the right amount of transparency here?

A solo creator with no network?

But that presumes time, existing relationships, or capital to pay for engagement. Not everyone has that runway.\n\n\n\nWe're essentially rewarding distribution sophistication more than content quality, which sounds efficient until you realize we're optimizing for who can game the system best, not who provides the most value.\n\n\n\nWhat's the solution?

So the formal rule is purity, but the system itself incentivizes coordination. That's a policy-practice mismatch, and creators are caught in the middle.\n\n\n\nCommunity norms are messier. In some niches, everyone knows everyone else is doing light momentum work (commenting, sharing in private groups), but there's an unspoken agreement not to talk about it publicly. It's the open secret.\n\n\n\nThe real code violation isn't the tactic itself—it's breaking the fourth wall. You can do it, but you can't admit you're doing it, because that disrupts the shared fiction of organic meritocracy.\n\n\n\nThis creates two problems:\n\n1. Newcomers who play by the stated rules get crushed by those who understand the real game.\n\n2. The discourse becomes dishonest. We optimize privately, but preach purity publicly.\n\n\n\nWhat happens if platforms actually enforced their stated policies hard—no early signal manipulation, strict penalties?

      "selftext": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder &amp; CEO of gliltech software",

Feature speed ground to a halt and we ended up with barely used features with crazy complex architectures that imagined that this feature was going to be centre of the future of the platform and was hideously over engineered, where the reality was most features missed the mark and were sidelined as we learnt what users wanted.\n\nAfter all that bullshit, we still needed to rewrite the whole thing about 24 months in as it was too bloated and complex to build on.\n\nI've come to realise that can't it's like the most immutable developer trait. Someone who likes building fast, hates slowing down and doing all the design stuff as they see it as time wasting, when they could be shipping features and someone who loves scalable coding usually thinks the other guys are idiots and they are far superior.

I'm not asking from a legal standpoint but I've always found that the people I hire that are most dedicated are also usually the worst at their actual job but also they are the ones most willing to follow a plan laid out for them to fix it. \n\nI've hired plenty of people who were really good at sales as an example (and I know that's a personality itself) and I could get them to sell anything and it was great. However, when something wasn't going right they were the biggest pain in the ass. One time, we didn't have the right business license in this state we were about to do a show in and it was 4:30PM on a Friday, one of my dedicated people (but not good at sales) called up the local license place and they said they had already closed for the day and she went and found a neighbouring town, called them up and begged them to stay open for a few extra minutes took a cab and drove out there and got the license. All without needing me to handhold her and she knew she didn't have time to wait for my permission but she also knew the show wouldn't happen without it. \n\nSo we worked on her weaknesses and I spent extra time training her and eventually just started hiring sales people to work under her because the amount of peace of mind I had with her was still worth it.",

It appears the entire middle market got destroyed by AI slop and low efort podcasts and generally there is a fear of income loss for any production.\n\nCreators spend a ton on production and editing etc and they are losing views and engagement to AI shorts about women washing dishes in the olympics. 4 millions likes that short got. There are clients with 10m+ subs getting less than 100k views now. So, its clear, AI will kill jobs in code generation and content creation.\n\nWhat exactly is going to pay everyone's bills??? Id love to know how everyone else is handling this.\n\nedit: a lot of comments are underestimating the magnitude of this. These are not just random people that will be directly or indirectly affected. It will be fathers and mothers. Brothers and sisters. Sons and daughters. And to those that think they are immune to AI, like mechanics, when people lose their jobs/incomes, they typically dont keep 2-3 cars.\n\nedit: apparently China waited for the markets to close before telling DJT we aren't getting those gpus.

From Hollywood to YouTube to agencies, the creative industry is currently in transition and anyone claiming to have the answers as to where it ends up is completely full of shit.

You get the point. \n\nI think there is a market for human made video production. I suspect the AI hype will fade and there will be a segment of the market that wants old school human storytelling. Similar to how the horse business has changed from everyone needing a horse to only a select few die hard fans really wanting them. \n\nWho knows. Maybe I’m wrong. But I think there is some lessons to be learned from history and similar market shakeups.",

The ones that focused on talent and high end were successful and the scraps were left to small businesses to fight over.\n\nThe businesses that will be hurt the most are the average ones.  Crappy businesses who can cut costs and let quality suffer will drive prices down, sole proprietors who are super talented will survive and high end businesses will be able to thrive - while the average good intentioned company who’s not particularly great at anything that has employees will struggle.\n\nThese companies need to make the right choices to navigate this.  For many this means talent and process.  Finding talent early is hard but keeps cost down.  Investing in process cuts costs significantly because time is the biggest factor we can control to compete.\n\nIt’s not hopeless - it just another reminder that the cycles of change are speeding up.  30 years ago, there was certainty for longer stretches.

Sales done by phone and email. All this could be automated. I think/ hope keeping this course will add value again. Like people are buying vinyl records. But yeah, we may have to automate processes to keep up with demand as well as the need to keep offering current news etc. Before a website existed to support a magazine. They kind of became parallel, creating interactions between the two doesn’t really work. The writing process is different in approach etc. So honestly no idea where this will leave the company.

Word-of-mouth converts into clickable links without any extra effort.\n\nMade $4500 last month and a 80% of that came from people just dropping the name in conversations.\n\nIf you're venture-backed with a marketing budget, you probably want a memorable brand name like Mistral or Clay.\n\nBut if you're bootstrapping and need scrappy distribution, super short plus meaningless might actually be a hack.\n\nGeniunly, I can't understand why this growth hack idea is not so widely cited or shared",

The truth is, the only way to hit 100 dollars a day or reach any level of success is to believe in what you’re selling and in yourself so completely that quitting isn’t an option. You have to decide you’ll make it happen no matter what, that you’d rather go broke chasing it than live comfortably working for someone else.\n\nIt takes 13 hour days, relentless hustle, and a mindset that borders on delusion while people smile and nod with half hearted support. You’ll fail again and again, but that’s part of the process. If you’re not willing to sacrifice comfort, sleep, and approval for what you believe in, don’t start at all. But if you are, if you truly commit, then you’ll find out what you’re made of and success will have no choice but to follow, $100 a day will become a memory and you’ll be asking someone how to make $5000 a day.",

Had a business partner, my boyfriend and later got married. 1.5 years later expanded to 1100sq ft. 14 years later, 2006 we sold the shop and moved out of the country. 2000 we broke ground and build a resort in Greece. In 2007 moved back and rebuilt in a nearby neighborhood of our original location where clients can find us again. We continued to build the resort abroad. 2008 the housing crisis hurt the business. We shifted from having employees to transitioning them to rental stylists. 2016 our marriage suffered. 2018 we closed the shop, divorced and I went on my own to continue to grow and shift the business model.

He wanted to listen to my experience and my take on starting a business. The first thing I told him is that it is so difficult. His face changed immediately May be he was expecting some delightful words. He might have had a rosy picture that running a business is all jolly good. \n\nHe said I can find investors, there is a 3 PhD holders team, R&amp;D IP and what not. There is this one client who may pay for the product if they can build it spending 800k$. So on paper it’s just words and promises. I told him that a business should run not because there is funding, or employees are working hard, or there is a trend you can surf on. A business runs when there are customers who are willing to pay for what you sell. Simple. And that part is the hardest in an economically turbulent world. And when revenue doesn’t flow in, everything else becomes tough. I await invoices as small as 2000$ which were not paid by clients for months. I told him that you will be choked every month with no light at the end of the tunnel. May be I should have just lied to him it’s going to be awesome. May be I should have said more nice things but I had very few nice things to say. How would you describe your journey to an aspiring entrepreneur? Roses or thorns? Or a mix of both?",

I spent years trying to build \"revolutionary\" products from scratch, including this esports betting platform where we were basically inventing everything as we went. Massive headaches, tons of wasted time figuring out if anyone even wanted what we were building. Now when I look at markets, I do exactly what you did - find something that's already working but has obvious pain points. The AI model switching thing is such a perfect example because anyone who uses multiple models feels that frustration daily. What's brilliant about your execution is you didn't try to out-feature the big player, you went the opposite direction and made it cleaner. I see this all the time in mobile development where apps get bloated trying to serve everyone, then someone comes in with a focused version and steals a chunk of users who just wanted something simple. The AppSumo deal sounds promising too - those lifetime deals can be tricky for recurring revenue but they're great for getting that initial user base and feedback. The validation aspect you mentioned is huge, most entrepreneurs waste months building in a vacuum when they could be looking at existing solutions and thinking \"how can I make this better for a specific group of people\" instead of trying to reinvent everything.",

Complete with projected revenue charts for year five and a detailed organizational structure for the executive team they'll hire... someday.\n\nMeanwhile, they haven't talked to a single potential customer.\n\nLook, I get it. Writing a business plan *feels* productive. It's concrete. You can show your parents and they'll nod approvingly. But it's also the world's most elaborate procrastination technique.\n\nHere's the thing - your business plan is going to be wrong. Not slightly off. *Catastrophically* wrong. Because you're essentially writing fiction about a market you haven't actually entered yet.\n\nWant to know if your idea works? Find three people who will pay you money for it. Not \"yeah that sounds cool\" people. Not your cousin who promises to buy it when you launch. Actual humans who open their wallets.\n\nThose three customers will teach you more in a week than six months of planning ever could. They'll tell you what features actually matter, what price point works, and which of your assumptions were completely backwards.\n\nThe business plan can come later, after you've proven someone actually wants what you're selling. Until then, you're just writing expensive fan fiction about your own startup.\n\nAm I wrong, or are we all just allergic to actual validation?",

In person networking - most b2b sales will come because of a referral, and doing in person networking.  Our first client actually came from a referral for a man I had helped 2 years earlier.  He had me on his email list so I decided to reach back out to him and share with him what we were offering, quickly saw the value and connected me with several of his clients which all signed on to our services.  We then started attending different networking groups.  The key here is that not a ton of direct sales happen from in person networking.  What happens is you build your referral base from networking and then they refer clients to you.  \n\n2. We read some books that showed us our marketing message was so good. Specifically Story Branding and Star with Why.  They helped so much.  Once we realized our messaging was wrong and updated it we started getting more and more traction from our networking.  \n\nI think most ppl ignore in person networking bc they are building an “online business” but if you are doing 2b2 it’s so key!",

          "body": "You’re not alone here, but the real issue isn’t your technical ability. It’s how you’re communicating your value. Most engineers try to sell what they do instead of what it means for the client’s business. Small clinics don’t care about data centers or infrastructure. They care about uptime, compliance, and how much productivity they lose when things break.\n\nIf you lead with “I design enterprise-grade infrastructure,” you’ll lose them immediately. But if you say, “I help healthcare practices eliminate downtime and avoid compliance risks through secure, high-availability networks,” now you’re speaking their language. You’re connecting your service to a tangible pain point instead of a technical feature.\n\nI’d also rethink your outreach approach. Cold calling small businesses usually fails because they don’t understand the value yet. Try partnering with MSPs, compliance consultants, or IT service providers who already have relationships with your ideal clients. Offer to take on the complex networking or cloud projects they prefer to refer out. One good partnership can do more than months of random outreach.\n\nFinally, start showing proof of expertise. Write short case studies or even quick LinkedIn posts about common mistakes you fix. Something like “how one clinic lost a day of patient data because of a bad firewall setup” or “how we reduced downtime by 80% with a small infrastructure tweak.” That type of content builds quiet authority and creates inbound interest over time.\n\nThe technical part isn’t what holds most consultants back. It’s learning how to translate that skill into business outcomes that decision makers actually care about. Once you do that, traction starts to come naturally.",

After you get your product down, THEN start selling. \n\nBecause once you get your product down, you can probably get your cost down as well. Because you’ll then be looking for other clients with the same issue, other than looking for different clients with different issues.",

I've been in sales for a while now and had become one of the top sales people in the region.  I can definitely attest that it is a skill.  Takes time maybe a few years to get some good results.\n\nThere are a few options.\n\n1) hire a sales consultant from a organisational or business development firm\n\n2) hire a sales staff with at least 3 to 5 years experience.  Part time maybe?  To get the ball rolling and then moving on to full time once he has steadied the business coming in.\n\n3) learn it yourself.  It's difficult to do on your own, I had the support of organisation and other staff, management etc.  This is because you have an idea that it is the sales side but still not sure because of lack of experience.  Thus the learning curve that takes at least 3 months speaking to 20 people a day to even get one sale can be especially daunting. \n\nfind other ways to get leads, marketing and advertising.  But when the leads come in, you still have to sell.  And if you haven't got the skill you might waste quite a few marketing dollars. It most likely will take 3 months to get your first sale.  Not counting the sale from beginners luck.  This is generally from a warm lead.\n\nFrom what I heard more and more b2b companies are using less and less cold calling.",

It's frustrating when you know you can deliver but can't get the first conversation. Your expertise isn't the issue, it's how you position it to your clients.\n\nHere's my take:\n\n1. Reframe from IT consultant to Problem Solver. Talking about data center and enterprise networking to small business owners sounds expensive and complex. They just want to know if your solutions can make their internet faster, stop their system from crashing etc. Repackage your offer around their core anxieties like reliability, security and simplicity.\n2. Stop Cold Calling and Start Building Trust. Cold calling is like charging a fortified wall without intelligence, it rarely works unless you are a sales prodigy. Instead, provide value first. Offer a free, simple network check-up or be the helpful person in the online forums and local business groups who answers IT questions. Don't sell, just help. Let them see you as an Ally.\n3. Find Partners, not just Clients. Your fastest path to clients is through partnerships. Reach out to Managed Service Providers, web developers or cybersecurity firms. They already have the trust of your target clients and often run into projects that are too complex for them, which is what you solve. propose a referral partnership.\n\nYou have the expertise. Now it's about layering on the trust and positioning. Once you are a trusted voice, your clients will come.\n\n(Source: I guide leaders on market engagement and write about these principles in \"The Strategic Treatise\", I will be starting a weekly \"Insight First Clinic\" on Reddit to break down problems like this.)",

Small clinics don't need connectivity and infrastructure design at enterprise scale. You're pitching high-end services to businesses that probably just need basic IT support.\n\nOur clients in IT consulting learned that enterprise networking clients aren't found through cold calls to random small businesses. They come from referrals, partnerships with MSPs who need specialist help, or targeting mid-sized companies actually doing infrastructure projects.\n\nData center and cloud infrastructure work goes to companies with 100 plus employees, serious tech budgets, and existing IT teams. Those deals come through warm intros, industry connections, or subcontracting with bigger consulting firms. Not cold calling dentist offices.\n\nIf you want small business clients, pivot your services. Offer managed IT support, cybersecurity assessments, cloud migrations for Office 365. That's what SMBs actually pay for. The enterprise networking stuff you're good at is overkill for their needs.\n\nBetter approach is partner with IT service providers who already work with your target clients. Offer to handle their complex networking projects when they need specialist help. You get clients, they get to serve their customers better without hiring full-time network engineers.\n\nJoin local tech groups, attend industry meetups, get to know other IT consultants and MSPs. Referrals and partnerships are how consulting businesses actually grow, not cold outreach to businesses who don't need what you're selling.\n\nFour months with zero traction means your targeting is wrong, not that you suck at sales. Fix who you're talking to before you worry about how you're talking to them.",

If they don’t offer what you do, they might send clients your way.\n4. **Make your online stuff look good**. Your website and LinkedIn should clearly show what you do. Share helpful tips or projects you’ve done. People check those before reaching out.\n5. **Tell everyone you know**. Friends, family, people you went to school or worked with. Just say, \"Hey I started this, let me know if anyone needs help.\" You never know who might connect you.\n\nGetting the first client is the hardest part, but once you do a good job, more will follow.

The AI tool did not take off because the cost of AI at present is a bit high (API model). What I understand is that most of them have their APIs linked to ChatGPT and the API cost is high making it difficult for profitability. Once the API cost comes down, I think there will be profitability in the system (not sure if it’d ever come down because most of these AIs are themselves in losses). I maybe wrong but this was my experience.",

The profitable AI businesses I've tracked share one pattern: they didn't start as AI companies, they added AI to solve a specific bottleneck in an existing workflow (driver routing, product descriptions, lead personalization). The ones that launched as 'AI startups' without a clear use case usually pivot or die within 6 months. On pricing: the successful ones charge for outcomes or time saved, not per AI call. If you're pricing per generation or query, your margins get crushed every time OpenAI raises prices. Better to package it as 'unlimited X for $Y/month' and manage your own cost efficiency internally.",

Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo!\n4. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week! \n5. Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!\n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well!\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

Beyond the more than apparent hallucinations that GPT-5 web searches tends to have, I prefer to separate my scattered searches from ChatGPT's memory context. Doing so leads to more coherent responses and better memory recall on ChatGPT's part.\n4. Claude: One word. Projects. You can attach folders from your Google Drive, and Pro Tip: files added to Claude Projects update in real time. ChatGPT's projects only download the state of a file at the time its uploaded. I'll regularly tweak my drafts in Google Docs and come back to my main Project and instantly ask Claude for new feedback. It's amazing. \n5. Notebook LM: not used as much as the others, but is essential when I want to comb through my note archives or want to extract information from a set of sources without data contamination.\n6. n8n\\*: building custom AI agents to perform API actions and other automations that can't be fulfilled by the services above.

Running a startup in 2025 feels like herding a bunch of smart but quirky AI assistants instead of a human team, and I've been deep in that chaos for the last year with my own side hustle. My go-to stack right now is Notion AI for brainstorming and organizing everything from product roadmaps to daily tasks it's saved me hours on summaries and drafts paired with Zapier to automate the grunt work like syncing leads from my website to CRM and firing off personalized emails without me lifting a finger.  \n For content and marketing, Jasper has been a game-changer for quick blog outlines and social copy that actually converts, but honestly, some of the early hype around tools like those flashy AI video generators turned out to be mostly smoke; they spit out generic stuff that needed heavy editing anyway. Drift's chatbot has been solid for initial customer chats though, qualifying leads 24/7 so I don't miss out on weekends.

      "selftext": "I spent 30 years building my healthcare media business before selling it to private equity in 2021. But before my successful exit, I failed to sell it four times.\n\n**The two biggest mistakes I made:**\n\n1. **Believing you need $10M+ in topline revenue before anyone will take you seriously** \\- This bad advice kept me from getting professional help early on in my selling journey. It also delayed my timing and kept me pointed at a north star that wasn't even true. There are hundreds of quality lower and middle-market M&amp;A firms and brokers who work with businesses well below $10M but with strong EBITDA.\n2. **Trying to manage the sale process myself** \\- I thought I could handle it since I'd built the business and we were small enough. Huge mistake. It's a massive time suck trying to sell, and managing that while growing or maintaining the business is virtually impossible.\n\n**What I found success in:**\n\nHaving someone in my corner who is an expert in the field, has past M&amp;A experience, and follows a proven process makes all the difference. Whether that's an investment bank, M&amp;A advisor, or quality broker depends on your size and situation, but trying to DIY your exit is a recipe for disaster in my opinion.\n\nAfter my deal closed, I stayed on as CEO, growing the business further, and then have spent my last three years sharing my exit journey with other owners who are trying or thinking about selling. I kept seeing many of the same patterns, all are strong business operators, but many are underprepared for selling, getting bad advice, or lacking clarity on what actually drives a successful sale.\n\n**Questions for other business owners:**\n\n* Do you subscribe to the age-old motto that all businesses are built to be sold? Is your dream to successfully exit your business or do you have other plans?\n* If you want to sell, what are the biggest factors standing in your way?\n* If you've sold a business before, what surprised you most about the process?\n* What's the worst advice you've heard about selling a business?\n\nHappy to share more about what worked (and what didn't) in my experience, but for now curious on all your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",

We were still doing our finances ourselves, as opposed to having a CFO or a proper finance person do them in-house, which as you suspect is immediately what I hired after going through the initial process.\n\nOn the second failed attempt, I got to the altar, literally the day of closing, and the buyer came back and said that their investment committee had changed their minds. This was after five months of due diligence by the way. That one really hurt.\n\nThe other two occasions, I got approached by public companies directly and started negotiations, but realized that negotiation on my own behalf was a loser's game. I had no leverage and couldn't play hardball and was going to end up with a low offer so I backed out.\n\nCan't share exact multiples, but the final deal was with a PE firm, and was a solid lower middle-market transaction. Fortunately large majority was cash at closing with a small retained equity %, and a small earn-out component tied to growth over the time I stayed on as CEO.\n\nNowadays, I'm working with my son on ExitClarity, an exit readiness platform for business owners considering a sale. My mission really is to try to help others avoid all the mistakes that I made when trying to exit, and if I can do that, maybe it'll feel a little bit like it was worth it taking all those lumps haha.",

          "body": "I just sold my company after 26 years and 2 failed attempts. \n\nMy plan was to grow my company through acquisitions.  That is much harder than you think. After 2 solid years of trying to buy other companies,  I decided I needed an equity partner. \n\nIn the last 4 years, I have been approached at least 3 times per week by brokers, PE. And strategic buyers. I had no intention of selling. Then,  I started talking to them. I was offered an LOI  by a strategic that I really liked for a fair amount of money. I didn't really want to go that route so I declined after a lot of negotiations and soul searching.\n\n I was then approached by a holding company that offered me a platform position. Dream come true, right? They offered me great money, but during the negotiations, they kept changing the deal to the point that we both decided to walk away. \n\nThe M&amp;A advisor from the buyers' side then called me up and said they felt that my company was stronger than the offers I was getting, and they wanted to represent me. We came to an agreement, and they put me in front of 6 different buyers. PE, strategic, and a few other types. \n\nI just sold to my dream buyer. Great track record for growth. I named the terms of the deal and got a high multiple.  They are great to work with, and we are in full acquisition mode as a platform. \n\nIt took many years of building the company I would want to buy, but it paid off. The advice OP is giving is right on. Get an advisor, an M&amp;A CPA, and a good attorney.  You need a quality team. Your CPA will also need to advise you on tax consequences.

I need to reach a certain point of success first - otherwise, it wouldn’t feel like the right time to exit.\n\nWhat makes selling hard right now is the amount of opportunity everywhere. There are so many directions you could go, and it’s easy to spread yourself too thin instead of doubling down on one clear sales channel. That’s been the toughest part for me.\n\nThe best advice I’ve heard about selling a business is this: sell sooner than when things start heating up in your industry. When everyone’s chasing the same wave, it’s already too late.\n\nI have one question. How early do you think founders should start preparing for an exit? Like, is it a 2 year process, or does it take even longer in your experience?",

          "body": "Greetings! Thank you for sharing your experiences. I have a physical operation that is niche entertainment but is immediately scalable that has outgrown me. In my area it could easily do far more what it does now in events. It has a unique track record though, especially since I acquired it in January of 2021, and the previous owner was ill for several years prior to that, so it was flying by the seat of its pants for quite some time. I happily have a large scale corporate agent who has watched me rebuild it and has a high interest in a strategic partnership. I have another entertainment business (physical with a growing digital component) that I have spent 20+ years building that has global potential, and I would much rather focus on developing that for the next 3-5 years, so this would be a great way for me to work on that with some financial security behind me. But I am learning all this as I go!  The tips for the team to hire in this thread were immediately valuable.\n\n My questions are: How do I start thinking in terms of negotiating value of items, intellectual property compensation, or salaries or pay for team members? I know with this partnership it would be an immediate value addition to their bottom line, and I don't want to sell myself short. They already have trucks, warehouse space, and an administrative team we would integrate into. Without even trying this business easily does 60 events per year and could do 10x that if it had the resources (as demonstrated by a long established competitor) and someone (not me) who thrives on a higher level of activity. I will be bringing them hundreds of new talent members, a whole set of equipment that is ready to make money, a growing client base with dozens of repeat clients, multiple formulas for multiple markets, plus a business name that has been around for over 20 years with a 5 star reputation. Of course there is so much more to the story, but those are the most salient points I can think of to start.\n\nThere was one year where we did over 100 events and still could have booked more, but that was the year I learned what the term \"uncontrolled growth\" meant and I immediately set about controlling it. We grossed $250,000 that year, but this is a VERY people dependent business so that came with a lot of headaches from other people. So I decided I would only do what I knew I could handle with a small trusted crew. We still are easily into six figures, but it operates on a boutique family level at the moment. Various family members lend skill and expertise and it contributes a form of support at the moment for all of us involved. Those family members ideally would be integrated into the partnership to help the transition over the next couple years. \n\nThat was a lot, but things are moving fast (as they always do) so any input is welcome! And if this was just a casual read for anyone, thank you for making it this far!",

Do things that give you cash right in your hand. Look what is possible in your area. Some granny wants help in her garden? Do it. Cash right after. Its way less than \"you could have somewhere else?\". Doesnt matter. Now is better than some dreams later. Fill your day with these little things. No matter how low its paid. Then you do these things 16hours a day, 7 days a week. Took me about 6months until I earned like twice the amount a good paying job(which I couldnt find) would have given me. \nDuring that time you shouldnt spent much but you wont have time for that anyways. \nTook me one year and a half like this to be able to buy a very broken house. I repaired it for another 2 years and sold it for 5x the buying price after. \n\nNow Im already living comfortably from savings for 3 years already.

I have been in corporate world since 2017 mainly in manufacturing, maintenance and facility engineering, and management experience. Ive done really cool things and built a pretty solid resume. Money has been great but im generally burned out. I several years back that I don't get fulfillment out of working for others but I stayed in the trap. I have my first child otw and I decided to leave a extremely well paying job with great benefits due to a horrible culture which honestly was turning into the worst version of myself. Hind sight, I believe i should have stayed at least until the baby was born and took my paternity leave but i figured if i didnt leave i probably never would. After i left in july, I started my own facilities and equipment consulting business. Ive been struggling on how to get things started even though I have the llc, website, business cards etc. I also dont really know how to sale, if that makes sense. I feel like im losing the fire thats in me that makes me, me. I believe i also have too much ego and pride that has been holding me back for the majority of my life, which i take full responsibility for. The burnout and loss of confidence honestly is tearing me apart as I have a pregnant wife and baby due in 3 weeks. We have a decent nest egg of savings but its tearing me apart as a man. How do I get the drive back and push through to do the one thing ive been wanting to do for years, which is have a business and work for myself. I understand there will be stress in any environment and im willing to grind through, no stranger to hard work. Has anyone experienced this and successfully started there business? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso to add, about 4 years ago we relocated to atlanta for my job and isolated our selves from all friends and family. I didnt realize how much of an impact it would have on me not being social and not having a team in your corner rooting for you. Again, this is all on me and having something to prove to myself at the time. My goal now is to be a good father, husband,  and to have fulfillment in my life with whatever job or business I do.",

Check out mentally for half the day for a month or 2. You're in a corporate job. Who cares? \n\nIf you're contemplating quitting anyway... just start mailing it in. Don't take your work home with you ...risk a bad review here and there. What are they going to do?  Fire you  ...after several months ...with a nice severance package?  Horrors.\n\nCertainly there's plenty of people in your corporation who are just doing the minimum. Just enough not to get fired.\n\nGive yourself a break from the stress and whatever happens happens. Maybe after a month you recharge and you kick back into gear and everything's good. Maybe you realize you didn't have to work so hard to begin with. Maybe you realize you do need to quit. It's all okay\n\nBut my opinion is if you're already burned out... Entrepreneurship is not the direction you want to go. The corporate folks who think it's the easy, low stress life...

Somewhere here you wrote that you set ego aside. I call this “killing the ego,” and this is one of the most important things for building a business, because when ego guides you, you risk missing out on very attractive opportunities that could hurt your ego. So you've already taken an important step toward your venture.\n\nSecond thought about focus. Someone here already wrote that you try to solve a lot of problems. It's okay, but you really should focus on only one thing. It seems your family, because the main purpose is to be a good father and husband. Leave all the other stuff for a couple of months, spend more time with your wife and after birth with both of them. I assume she understands your mood and worries the same as you.

I see him stress from time to time but two days ago I met him at his lake house and helped take his boat out of the water. He's fielding calls while we're doing it, but he manages it well. He and his family just came back from South Africa for a 2 week safari. He gets to do a lot that most people don't, and it does come at a cost. \nSome other thoughts:\nHe and I trade entrepreneur podcasts constantly. Alex Hormozi is a great one for business and specifically sales marketing. That may help.\nMake sure you're exercising. When I get mega stressed it's usually because I haven't moved or stretched in a while. Guard your health like your life depends on it. \nStarting a business usually fails for most because they give up after the first try. The first try often does not go well. \nIf you're having trouble selling hire a guy. If you can't afford to hire him, give him a fat commission. All the good guys I know are 100% commission \nGet a good job for now.  Keep that job and run your business on the side until you get some sales coming in and you can't afford to keep your regular job. Try and get a remote job. \nAbove all else: take care of your wife. Your kid will feel the tension in your relationship. You have to be the best husband to be the best father. \nGood luck and love that kiddo up. You can do this. ",

This is important so that you don't burn through tens of thousands of dollars on a dead business. I did this. The market will let you know if your idea or business makes sense. \n\nHonestly, most businesses fail especially on the first attempt. You have to invest in you and gain practical knowledge. Having a baby on the way is not the ideal time to start this full-time. \n\nI'd recommend you find at least a part time job and set realistic goals for business to test its viability. For example: close one client in 30 days. As you get more clients, you start to get a clearer idea of who to target. \n\nFinally invest in learning how to create ads for social media. If you are not ready to cold call, then shoot cold DMs. I wouldn't recommend emails yet because they go to spam and feels like more rejection when no one responds. That's my 2 cents.",

I know people making real money. None of them are posting about it on Reddit.\n\nThe ones killing it are too busy actually working. They're dealing with customer support tickets, fixing bugs, negotiating with suppliers or just trying to keep their head above water as they scale.\n\nMeanwhile, the loudest voices online are usually:\n\n* Selling courses on how to make money (their actual business)\n* Inflating numbers by counting gross revenue instead of profit\n* Showing one good month and pretending it's consistent\n* Straight up lying for engagement\n\nI fell for this early on. Felt like a failure because I wasn't hitting these crazy numbers everyone else seemed to reach effortlessly. Spent months feeling inadequate because my business was \"only\" making $3k/month.\n\nThen I met some of these \"successful\" people at conferences. The guy with \"$50k MRR\"? Living with his parents. The woman with the \"7-figure agency\"? That was gross revenue across 3 years, not annual. After expenses and taxes, she was making less than a corporate job.\n\nHere's what real business growth looks like:\n\n* Year 1: Losing money, everything breaks, you question everything\n* Year 2: Maybe breaking even, still everything breaks\n* Year 3: Small profit, things break less often\n* Year 4: Decent profit if you haven't quit\n\nThe sustainable businesses making good money took years to build. The owners aren't posting screenshots. They're boring businesses solving boring problems.\n\nStop comparing yourself to these people online. Most of it's fake anyway. The real entrepreneurs are too busy building to post about it.\n\nFocus on your customers. Make something people actually pay for. Let everyone else focus on the screenshots.\n\nYour competition isn't as far ahead as they claim to be :)",

He asked to use our bathroom, I said no (we didn’t have a public restroom), his response was “I’m not going to do drugs in there”, which made it an extra no. I asked him to leave.

But we're known for our produce (and we're also a SNAP retailer) so it's a necessity. Produce has different phases: A Grade, B Grade, Free Grade, Piggy Grade, and Compost. We don't have enough B Grade to warrant a trip out to a food rescue organization so we started a \"free table\" where we would put unsellable but still edible produce and other items. Folks from all tax brackets would take from the free table but most importantly: food insecure folks could take from it without having to feel awkward about it.\n\nWell this one unhoused guy decided it was his personal buffet and would eat from it all day. I started offering him bags to take anything he wanted to go. He decided that outside of our store was his home. He would try to come in after closing hours to ask for more free food. One time, I was working from inside the locked store (lights were off and blinds were down) and I felt someone staring at me. I looked up and he was bent down so he could stare at me from under the blinds. That was the first time I called the cops.\n\nWe stopped putting out the free produce for a while because he creeped us out so much (for a multitude of reasons). Customers expressed disappointment so when we hadn't seen the creeper for a long while, we decided to bring it back. Well then creeper man got out of jail and resumed his antics. I was setting up the table and ran into him and we had a nice conversation where he seemed sober + thanked me for feeding him. I offered him a to go bag and he informed me that he was planning on hanging out because he likes it in front of my store. I very politely gave a reason for why he should hang out in one of the more comfortable spots in the area and he went ballistic. I tried to deescalate the situation and he threatened to kill me. I called the cops again, got a different officer, who informed me that sometimes people say things they don't mean.\n\nSince the cops don't care about the safety of my team + my neighbors, the free table is gone permanently and the good free stuff goes to the unhoused people in the neighborhood who periodically check in on us to make sure creeper man hasn't been bothering us.",

I have given out free food to homeless people before and have eventually seen them bite the hand feeding them in the same way.\n\nE.g., I used to give them free burgers and fries once a week. Eventually, they asked why they couldn’t get pricier wings or a philly cheesesteak for free, or even a bottled drink instead of a fountain drink. Called me cheap and got angry that I refused to give him more free food beyond the burger and fries.\n\nYou gotta remember a lot of homeless folks are mentally unwell, so you can’t really let their reactions get to you. Heck, a lot of customers in general are also clearly mentally unwell. Same thing, really.\n\nThere is footage you can find on YouTube of homeless people displaying the same entitlement outside of restaurants too. Free cookout held by volunteers? Some of the homeless start complaining about why they couldn’t use freshly-made ground beef instead of frozen patties from Walmart. It’s insane sometimes.",

I was desperate to grow a portfolio to the point I started offering my services for free.\n\nStill no one accepted my services. After 3 months I got immediately burnt out and ended all operations until my one client that I kept told me that I could actually make a living doing my services.\n\nI didn't want to hear it and told them fuck no I hated everything I did for my llc. My client then told me \"You can chose what services you offer.\" That's when I gave it another go.\n\nHowever, I remember what this subreddit said to me and instead of going back to my llc, I completely rebranded, decided that I'm never going to create a portfolio or run ads.

There's no other secret sauce. \n\nI had huge dreams of my business taking off in a year. 9 months in, I still didn't have a single sale. I had however found a partner willing to put in tens of thousands in capital when a customer eventually came along. I had also spent the time building my logistics network (import agents, export process, licenses etc). I went back to my full time job to keep afloat and continued relentlessly knocking on physical and virtual doors. I changed my target customer from large volume buyers to smaller volume buyers. I even experimented with B2C. \n\nThis is my third year and I'm on track to gross $300k. Not a lot but it's money FINALLY. \nNext year I'll make a profit.",

However they cant make it a full week without calling in or being 20 minutes or more late. The attendance has been an ongoing issue. \n\nSomeone reported to me that the manager was playing a mobile game when I wasn't in the office. I checked the CCTV and sure enough, they did play a game for about 40 minutes on the clock. But when searching for the clip, I also saw them hide $10 worth of magic erasers in their purse!\n\nI think its time I pull the trigger and fire them? Its so hard when we have built so much.",

Everyone does that.   Not play games, but waste time. Its part of having a job.  But bosses are obsessed about time and not tasks.   25 years ago I was a service manager at a car dealership. The owner insisted everyone clock out at 5pm. Not early.  So during the last 15 minutes of the day people would just stand in a line by the time clock, waiting until exactly 5pm.  So much money wasted. And time.  I've noticed that bosses care more about employees being unhappy that actually getting work done.   I also spent time as a buyer for a company. I could have layed in bed at home and called the places and did the work. Would have been more effective most likely. But I had to go into work, sit at a desk, wear a suit even though nobody from the public was ever in our building, and make calls there.  Half the day I was just sitting there waiting on hold or waiting to make a call.  \n\nThe biggest thing is the person being late or calling off.  That drives me crazy.   Employees that show up are super valuable.   I've ignored employees stealing thousands of dollars from me just because they actually showed up each day and never called off lol. \n\nI'm going to assume you are a new business owner since you are asking these questions.

Phil had broad responsibilities, including purchasing inventory. Over the years, it became clear to them that Phil had deals with some of the vendors for kickbacks paid to him and some other shady dealings. Basically, they knew that Phil was stealing 1-2% of what he was purchasing, which amounted to $100k+ per year.\n\nMy dad told me this, and I (naturally!) asked why he didn't fire Phil on the spot. His reply was a business lesson that stuck with me over the decades since.\n\n\"I could let him go, of course. But I prefer to look at that 1-2% as part of the cost of doing business. Sure, Phil costs the company money with his theft, but he is also so fiercely protective of his grift that he makes sure we get a good deal anyway, so we won't suspect him. Plus, he watches all the other employees like a hawk to ensure they're not skimming, so we won't get suspicious. This way, your mom and I can take a two week vacation if we want to, and we know it costs 1-2%. We can stomach that, and it's worth it for us. Is it right? No. But it's practical.\"\n\nSo, ask yourself - if this employee came to you and said, \"I'll keep doing a great job, but I'm going to steal $100/month worth of time and supplies. Is that OK?\" What would you say? If you'd agree to keep this person, then just pretend that conversation happened and move on. It costs a lot more to find, train, and keep another manager.\n\nIs it right to let this guy steal $10 worth of supplies? Or 40 minutes worth of time? No. But perhaps it's practical.",

It wasn't a big deal but I did tell them I'd appreciate if they would ask in the future because in that case the cord had a specific purpose but I didn't think they were trying to be shady\n\n  \nSo I guess my point isn't that they are a good employee or an awful employee...but rather and employee that maybe became too comfortable and you haven't had the kind of disucssion you need ot have with them.",

I personally would not be concerned over this as long as my total slippage remains within industry standards (meaning they were really only taking for personal usage on rare occasions).

      "selftext": "I make websites and do digital marketing and there's so much going on in the industry with new AI changes, new tools, Google changing things up, new strategies, etc., that I wanted to try to make a meetup to meet new people (potential people to hire and potential new clients). I moved to a new city last year and in my old city there was a big scene for marketers with meetups and conferences every week, so I wanted to start something similar here. \n\nI spent $100 on the venue, $100+ on catering, spent money on flyers, and spent a lot of time making the presentation I was going to give, hanging up flyers at dozens of local businesses, meeting business owners, and promoting on meetup.com, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Several people RSVP'd and I had close to 50 people interested or saying they would come including my friends. I promoted the event with my small team every day for 5 weeks sending reminders just enough to not be annoying. \n\nI got there and set everything up and... nothing. No one came. One person had been asking me questions on meetup named Curtis and I saw one person there who looked like him so I went up to say hello and introduced myself and he looked at me strange and said his name was Shawn and it was nice to meet me. SO AWKWARD. I casually played it off and left him alone, then waited 30+ minutes after the start time by the front door of the venue like some kind of 1970's breakup song to see if anyone would show before packing up my stuff and going home. \n\nNext month I was planning a follow up and was going to have a guest speaker come out, but now I'm thinking of emailing him (a respected name in my field) and canceling next month because it would embarrass me even more. \n\nMaybe Thursday nights aren't good? Maybe 6:30pm is a bad time for a business event? Maybe my offer wasn't good enough? Maybe something else was going on last night that I didn't know about? Maybe I should have tried paid ads on the radio or Facebook instead? Maybe I should try changing it to Saturday and pay a big name to appear? Maybe this town isn't interested in marketing and I need to try the big city 30 minutes away?\n\nI guess I'm just venting into the void here. I used to be in bands and I've definitely played shows where no one came, so this is nothing new, but it's never fun to go through it. \n\n\n\nI realize I'm not good at in-person event promotion and need to keep trying things until I make progress.",

We've been working all day and want to relax in a chill setting. Take a few minutes at some point to thank any sponsors, caterers, etc. Ask for feedback for future events, and ask people to think about who they would invite to the next one to make this better for everyone. If you tell me theres a speaker and it starts at 5:30, if I cant make it on time, im not going to show up AT ALL. (LOL show up late in the middle of a speaker's presentation? How embarrassing! Sorry I couldn't make it!)\n\n\n- Make it a networking event where they can promote themselves and their business, and mingle with other professionals. If you make it 5-7, people can drift in and out. Some people can leave work early, some will show up late, and people can come and go as they please.\n\n\n- I need to stress this needs to be an opportunity for the networkers to meet new people and expand into new markets. The main attraction needs to be the attendees. All the successful independent networking events I go to do this. The host NEVER spends time peddling their own product; they go mingle and build relationships just like everyone else has to. Don't worry, people will remember you and that you hosted the events.\n\n\n- See if you can find a venue you can pay for where drinks are available. A slower night at a restaurant with a bar or something. Buy some appetizers but tell everyone to support your host and buy a drink! Give the venue host a minute to speak if they want.\n\n- As you grow ask if people have swag or door prizes to donate. Put business cards in a bowl for drawings (must be present to win, keeps some people there longer). \"We have a gift card here for a free 30 minute massage from Queen Spa.\" \"Up next is a branded tumbler from Reddit Bank and trust!\" \"A floral arrangement made by Flowers Unlimited, donated as a prize from Care Today Urgent Care. Thank you Care Today for this lovely prize. Let's see who's taking it home!\"\n\nTL;DR: no speakers, make it easy to come and go, find a venue (and give the venue an opportunity to make money aka the bar, also buy some appetizers), and focus is on the people attending. This is for them and about them.\n\nP.S. take this with a grain of salt I am tall, white, and handsome. Sample size of 1 and a lot of those factors probably play more into that than my actual ability.\n\nP.P.S. I'm not saying I'm handsome as a brag. I just realized its a factor, and I found out because when my wife goes with me to networking events, she extends her hand to shake the hand of EVERY SINGLE OTHER WOMAN that approaches us at light speed. \"Hi I'm xxx, Hailhydra's wife. Nice to meet you.\" Before she did this, other women ive known a long time through networking would come up and we'd give each other a hug. She put a stop to that quick lol.\n\nP.P.P.S my mom said I was handsome too. So sample size of...2?",

Invite them to thank them for their business, and ask them to bring other community members.\n\nIf you're good, in this economy, at finding new clients and new work, you will absolutely figure this out.

Gather way more feedback from people who match your target attendee persona. \n\nFrankly, I'm more of a fan of pitching the idea in detail and then getting people to pay for a ticket in advance before you even start setting up the event. Try Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.. \n\nIn this way, if it flops, you've wasted no time and money, saved yourself a lot of effort and heartbreak, and ruled out that particular event idea. You can validate ideas and demand in this way without wasting money, time, effort, and other resources.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with in-person events.

Saying this so you can understand I might know quite a bit about what is going on here.\n\nFor people saying 6:30 is too late, I completely disagree. It's actually the most perfect time you could be doing it. All of my events are either at Lunch OR 6:30pm.\n\nSo several things. 1. If the goal of the event is to talk to people and you had Curtis already reaching out and asking questions why not just jump on a call with him? That to me, feels like an immediate win with a lot of upside. Even giving you the immediate ability to pitch something.\n\n2. Your venue will absolutely make or break your event. Pubs will always have extremely low turn out. Especially if you are Targeting professionals. Want to know where you can have meetups that won't cost you anything? Coffee shops like Panera Bread.\n\nMy first several meetups were at Paneras or Starbucks and once I grew the groups to around 30 people consistently coming out, I was able to use that to get bigger venues to donate the space, like co-working spaces. Especially if you have people in tech or marketers because they love having remote offices they can work out of. Best part, Panera is free. They just want folks there to buy snacks or coffee. So you save all of that money alone. Several hundred dollars in your pocket now.\n\nI am a very big believer in Value for time and a meetup will break if you don't figure out what that looks like. What is the value for their time being there, driving there, and then driving home. If they are THINKING about driving there and can't figure out what the value is, they will just make a turn and go home instead of going there.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas and if you want to DM me or reach out to ask more, happy to explain more.",

When I was in corporate, a great way to capture us is to start with drinks/finger food from 4.30/5pm in a venue that is walkable from the office (a bar works well) and to start the talk around 5.30pm. If you're doing a more serious presentation (which may attract less people than the casual get together), do it on a Friday afternoon 12.15-1pm with lunch offered. Maybe have coffee with a few of your target audience and casually ask them about their preferred time, and suggest to that guy to bring in his teams/friends.",

Do as much of the work yourself to keep the cost down.\n\nWhen printing the cards we made ours the max size so they stand out against the letters and other smaller postcards people get. Once you get into printing thousands it gets much cheaper. PUT AN OFFER ON THE CARD (we would say something like bring this card in to get a free xxxxx with any purchase). \n\nMax you can mail and add to the cart at the time is about 5k households if I remember correctly. You create an online account at USPS and select the mail routes you want them to go to. You can even filter for age, avg income. You put the cards in bundles with sheets for each route and drop them off at the post office. \n\nWe get people that bring them in months even a year later...so they're still paying off and we opened that store almost 2 years ago.",

You also want it to have the correct legal verbiage to allow you to collect the business credit information, as well as personal credit info. It should outline your credit terms (N30/2% Interest in balances owing, yadda yadda), steps/fees to collect, etc. The credit application I created also had separate legal verbiage for a personal guarantee.\n\nOnce you have all that signed, it should be passed onto whatever business credit bureau you've chosen to partner with, preferably one that can also provide personal credit reports.

Which make just be too expensive of customer acquisition cost. I think you’re cooked tbh, as far as growth. \n\nThe changes to the SEO probably killed your whole current growth model. You were likely able to really maximize the bang for your buck under the old structure, and no one except google is going to know for sure why it changed and/or what you can do about it.\n\nYou would not be at all the first to have this problem after a major update. Any time this happens, some companies get crushed. It might be possible to recover, but also possible you just had the perfect mix of whatever factors mattered. As time goes on, people will know better, but then as more people know, they’ll change it again. \n\nSo you can keep spending money on SEO and consultants, but you’ll probably just burn it all. I know there’s going to be some consulting firm out there that actually has a very good idea of what the changes are, but that’s going to be impossible to truly determine you’re going with the right one, except doing it and seeing the results.\n\nSo just comes down to how much money you want to gamble. Could work, could not. \n\nIf your risk tolerance is low, I’d look at selling your business based on the value of the brand / customer relationships.

These hotels aren’t in great shape, but they’re far from ruins... they’re fully operational and listed on Booking.\n\nSome prices are wild (for example, found this one with [50 rooms for €450,000](https://www.buythathotel.com/listing/scenic-hotel-for-sale-in-tabiano-terme)). Of course, they’re not in top locations like Lake Como or the Amalfi Coast, but... it’s still Italy, with its culture, great food.\n\nAll the ones I’ve looked at are run by elderly owners who just want to retire. They have zero tech or marketing skills and haven’t invested much in the properties over the past decade.\n\nSo I figured that with some alternative concepts, like coliving, it would be nearly impossible not to make money (or at least be able to sell in a few years for a profit). Bureaucracy will probably be an issue, but that’s the case everywhere in Southern Europe.\n\nSo what’s the catch?",

          "body": "My on-the-ground anecdotal perspective (American expat living in a Ligurian tourist town):   \n  \n1 - Italy's population is skewed older... the typical value-add things like marketing, digital presence, have zero value to the biggest demographic. This spans across industries - hardly anyone has a website, and if they do it looks like one from the 1990's.   \n  \n2 - Italians really seem to like to preserve the traditional things - e.g., in my part of Liguria, they actively discourage street performers, creative artists, any non-Italian cuisine. There is a lot of local government regulation put into preserving the status quo. (this has pros and cons but for your purposes, probably a con)  \n  \n3 - You really should look into the tax situation and labor rights. You will quickly find that the economics are really tough and entrepreneurial success is essentially disincentivized big time, IMO. As a result, 'bare bones' businesses seem to be the norm - both my veterinarian and my optometrist have no web presence, make appointments by texts via WhatsApp, and they are the receptionist, the doctor, the accounting department and the cleaning staff in their business. i.e. sole proprietors, no employees.   \n  \nGood luck!",

Run a ln hotel in Milan can be really different from running an hotel in the south.\nYou may both have success in making a capsule hotel or a real rural and traditional hotel but you need to know where it is located.\nThat said be prepared to pay for really High labour costs (skyrocketed by taxes you have to pay for the worker if u hire him).\nIn general nobody here is against a foreigner owner, but they will tell you how to handle the hotel because people will expect Italian logics and standards.\nDon't expect a neutral management.\nThe cheap costs may require, by contract, you to restore the building if you buy it and so on.",

Seemed like the sky was the limit. We make a product and sell both online and in person. We also have a storefront/production facility. \n\nOur online sales grew consistently until they peaked at 10k in March. They’ve since stabilized around 30% below that. We’ve released new products, explored other markets, and maintained consistent presence where we’ve had success. Yet we seem to lose a customer for every one we gain. \n\nI always thought gaining the initial customers would be the hardest part of running a business. For the third year in a row, I’ve been proven wrong. Any advice for growing beyond this point? I’m in the wellness sector",

          "body": "Three years stuck at the same revenue means you've got a retention problem, not an acquisition problem. You're churning customers as fast as you're bringing them in, which means either your product isn't sticky enough or you're targeting the wrong people.\n\nWellness products need repeat purchases to grow. If customers buy once and disappear, you don't have a business, you just have expensive one-time transactions. Our clients in wellness who broke through this plateau focused obsessively on getting customers to buy 2-3 times, not just converting new people.\n\nYour online sales dropping 30% from peak is a red flag. That's not normal fluctuation, something changed. Did you stop doing what was working? Did ad costs spike? Did a competitor launch? You need to diagnose what actually caused that drop instead of just accepting it.\n\nReleasing new products when your existing ones aren't retaining customers is just spreading yourself thinner. Fix retention on what you already have before you add complexity. Get your current customers buying more frequently or in higher amounts.\n\nThe storefront gives you an advantage most online wellness brands don't have. Use it to build real relationships with local customers who become regulars. Those people should be your core base that stabilizes revenue even when online fluctuates.\n\nFor breaking past $200k, you need either way better retention so your customer base actually grows instead of staying flat, or you need to increase average order value so the same number of customers generate more revenue. Pick one and focus there for 6 months.\n\nCheck your numbers honestly. What's your repeat purchase rate? If it's under 30%, that's your problem. What's your customer lifetime value? If people only buy once for $50, you can't profitably scale. Fix those fundamentals before you worry about growth tactics.",

Even spoons up 30%, and so much other stuff. \n\nWe tried to fight it with waste control, portion control, labor control, adding higher-margin items, etc. It kinda helped at first, but eventually we decided to raise prices by $1 across the board this following Monday. However, everything keeps going up and not going to stop. \n\nThe problem is, you can’t just keep increasing prices every month. Customers can only handle so much before they start walking because fundamentally they are still getting the same check, if not less. It’s honestly insane right now. And it’s scary seeing how many restaurants are shutting down lately around us. \n\nSo I’m just wondering, what’s your current situation like? How are you guys managing to survive this mess?\n",

Wix locks you in and Durable is trying to solve problems that don't really exist for most small businesses.\n\nThe real cost difference shows up at month 12. Wix at $30/month plus inevitable upgrades hits $500/year. WordPress hosting plus a decent theme is maybe $150 total annually. If the business grows you can hire any developer to customize it, not just Wix specialists.\n\nSkip the website builder comparison paralysis. Pick WordPress with a good theme like Astra or GeneratePress, spend 2 hours following a setup guide, done. The time you save not researching builders is worth more than the platform differences.",

I used excersise as the main driver but also having really busy weekends off helped. Up at 6am and filled the day with stuff. It could be gym at 7-8, cook a good breakfast, a walk in the park from 9-11am then a coffee date with my partner and then a trip into the city in the afternoon, then a cheap comedy show in the evening. Do two days like that and Monday comes around and you feel like you've not thought about work forever. The worst thing you can do in my opinion is spend a whole weekend doing a couple things as your brain when your painting is probably mostly on autopilot and drifts to work stuff, at least mine does all the time.

You can’t expect yourself to perform well in any business or job if your body and mind are on life support.\n\nGo for walks, take small breaks throughout the day, go to the gym, play video games, read books, eat healthy food, etc.\n\nDo what you like to do so you don’t get burnt out.

While our financial performance appears to be satisfactory on paper and operationally, we continue to incur a monthly loss of approximately $16,000.\n\nOur weekly sales exceed $45,000, with a gross profit margin of approximately 64% and a wage expense of 28%. However, the primary contributor to our financial challenges is the substantial amount we allocate to delivery aggregators. This month, despite a total sales of $237,000 (representing five weeks according to the retail calendar), we incurred approximately $37,000 in payments to Uber and DoorDash.\n\nDespite these substantial sales figures, we persist in operating at a loss. Given our limited capacity as a franchise, what strategies can I implement to improve our financial situation? \n\nEdit: Another problem is, I have a gym next door and we have a shared drive-way with them. The gym customers take all the parking spots, even they park on the driveway. This makes it extremely difficult for drivers to-thru customers. My google review is full with people cursing gym folks for their bad parking practices. I get only 400 cars per week in my drive-thru as opposed to 1700 in a drive-thru of another store situated in quieter road than mine. ",

Offer a small discount for direct orders (still cheaper than 28% commission).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Delivery zone optimization\\*\\* - Are you delivering too far? Tightening your radius can cut delivery times and costs. Most customers order within 3km anyway.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Minimum order value\\*\\* - If you're not already doing this, set minimums that make the economics work. Better to lose a $15 order than subsidize it.\n\n\n\n4. \\*\\*Ghost kitchen model\\*\\* - Some franchises are shifting to delivery-only locations with lower overhead. Could you test a smaller, cheaper location for delivery orders only?\n\n\n\n5. \\*\\*Negotiate with aggregators\\*\\* - At your volume, you have leverage. Many will reduce commission if you commit to exclusivity or higher volume.\n\n\n\nThe real question: What's your customer acquisition cost through aggregators vs other channels? If they're bringing NEW customers who become regulars, the fee might be worth it short-term.\n\n\n\nWhat's your current split between aggregator orders vs direct orders?",

The brutal math here is that youre paying roughly 15.6% of total revenue just to delivery aggregators, which when combined with your 28% labor costs is eating up almost half your gross profit before you even touch rent, utilities, or other overhead. What most franchise owners dont realize is that you can actually negotiate better rates with these platforms once you hit certain volume thresholds, plus theres consolidation software that can help manage multiple platform orders through one system so you dont miss orders during peak times. At vGrubs we work with restaurants to aggregate all their delivery platforms into one dashboard and help optimize their delivery operations to actually turn those orders profitable instead of just break-even customer acquisition tools.\n\nThe parking situation is probably costing you way more than the delivery fees though since drive-thru customers typically have much higher profit margins than delivery orders.",

          "body": "Those delivery fees are absolutely brutal, I feel for you. We work with tons of restaurants at Kea AI and that 15-16% you're paying to delivery platforms is just insane when you're already operating on thin margins. The math just doesn't work for most places.\n\nHere's what I've seen work for similar situations. First, you gotta start building your own direct ordering channel aggressively. Since you're on a busy roadway with good drive-thru traffic, focus on converting those customers to order direct next time. Simple stuff like receipt inserts with a discount code for direct orders, or even just training staff to mention \"next time you can skip the wait and order ahead on our app.\" The goal is getting people off those expensive platforms gradually.\n\nSecond thing is optimizing your phone orders since thats free revenue. Make sure every call gets answered professionally because missed calls during lunch rush are literally money walking away. A lot of places lose thousands just from unanswered phones when they're busy. Even something as simple as a proper phone system that queues calls instead of going to voicemail can help capture more of that direct business.\n\nThe delivery platforms aren't going anywhere but you dont have to be completely dependent on them. Start tracking what percentage of your sales come from each channel and set a goal to reduce that delivery platform percentage by even 5% over the next few months. With your volume that could save you almost $1000 monthly. Small changes add up fast when you're doing $45k+ weekly.",

But then under \"Contact a Lender\" it literally named two of their competitors by name. It straight up told people to call these other businesses. \n\n  \nAlthough their site was mentioned in the carousel, it wasn't mentioned in the answer at all. \n\nThat query was high intent, and although the users domain ranks top 5 in the blue links and was included in the carousel, it wasn't referred and they got cut out compeletely. \n\n  \nI'd honestly recommend everyone here to take 5 mins asking Google/ChatGPT/Perplexity etc questions about your business and see what happens. Are you getting recommended (not just in the carousel but in the answer) or is your competiton. \n\nFull disclosure, my work is in this space, so I'm looking at these results all day and thought it was an important warning to share with other business owners who rely on search for customers. \n\nAnyone else seeing stuff like this in their industry?

Every single lawsuit between the franchisor and franchisees is required by law to be listed in the FDD. The franchisor i worked for often settled out of court to show FDD'S with no lawsuits.\n\n\nSubway's FDD is insane, like 2 bibles stacked on top of each other and 90% of it is lawsuits. I struggle to make sense of how someone receives that, sees all the lawsuits, and says, \"I still think I can make this work.\" If the article is true and there are 37 former Dickey's franchisees, shame on both Dickey's and anyone who buys one and fails (seriously, did you not bother to read the document before you forked over hundreds of thousands of dollars?)\n\nThen again, most may not have lawsuits because in the franchise agreement, you agree that all legal matters / arbitration takes place in the home county / state of the franchisor. Their legal counsel just has to drive down the road while you're buying plane tickets and hotels.\n\n\nMy former employer was careful to never gave sales projections, but if someone asked if they could make $50k a month in revenue, I'm sure the salesperson would tell them it's possible (and technically it would be possible, but the salesperson didn't tell you that you were going to make 50k a month; you did).\n\n\nThe last thing is people would lie on reporting their net worth. If my old company said you need $200k to cover franchise fees / equipment / build out of space, and access to another $150k for operating expenses until break even / profitability, people would just sign away that they had access to money like that even if they really didn't (and we have no way of checking because it could be inheritance, mommy and daddy, or in 1 instance a lady signed up for 16 credit cards at the same time to cover operating expenses).\n\n\nTL;DR please for the love of god don't sell yourself on the dream of owning your own business and throw common sense out the window. Go talk to current franchisees on your own if youre looking at a franchise. And if the numbers don't add up, don't do it.",
