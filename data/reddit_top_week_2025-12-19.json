I’m nowhere near being able to quit my job, but it’s enough for me to work here and there as I have spare time and build up a catalog of content to sell. It’s ebooks, for adults. With nsfw content. 😂 go figure people want that kind of stuff. Anyways, I sell it on some different storefronts and build up a readership following me. I’d say half is AI, but the other half is good creativity, else you just get lost in the storm of bad AI content. Anyhow, if anyone wants to know more, it’s pretty specialized stuff and most people don’t make much. But it’s possible. And from what I can tell, there are a lot of people out there making a lot of money in the same sort of niche. I also sell custom stories too, which I can partially make with AI. And though that’s more work, I have made almost $2k this year from 5 of those sales! \n\nEdit: Go to authormeta.com to learn as I did\n\nEdit 2: I learned from Jezebel Rose.

Just moved it online and will be doing farmer's markets in summer to expand and extend the season. Started with about $1,000 10 years ago. Hoping to double my income, but we'll see.\n\nMy previous one was selling jewelry and accessories on eBay. I did that for about 5 years, and it helped me through some very tough financial times. I had a fun store where most people bought several items and often came back. That netted $2K-$5K/month depending on the season.\n\nAnother one that was super successful for a year ($100K that year) about 15 years ago was self-publishing books. I got lucky with a few that went viral. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to keep writing for myself, but I'm working on it now. I have several books going through the pipeline, and my launches will start in January. I have three niches I'm working in, but one is starting to stand out as having more potential.",

If you know the isolation requirements to keep varieties pure, you can start to imagine the huge tracts of land required to supply those varieties! \n\nBigger seed companies don't have that much land. They're able to provide so many by contracting out their growing. Each company has different requirements, but they're usually pretty clear about them. \n\nI tend to focus on Baker Creek, because they pay really well and their contracts are forgiving if things go wrong. And things will go wrong sometimes! But just be open and honest about it, they know what plants are like. They'll understand.\n\nYou can be a contract grower with any amount of space. For small gardens they'll probably focus on herbs and flowers. Large gardens and farms, they might ask you to grow 100 pounds of dry beans, or 500 eggplants, stuff like that.\n\nI'm a little obsessive about plants, so this works for me. I've tried selling seeds directly to customers, and I just don't have the people skills or the executive function needed for that! For me, mass-growing and then selling to a big company is the best fit for my skills and personality.\n\nI'm hoping to expand soon, but I'm \"between houses\" at the moment and had to take a break from contract growing entirely.",

          "body": "Most realistic path is freelancing if you're willing to learn a skill. I agree with the paid ad campaign suggestion in the comment, basically become the media buyer and run the ad platform, but it requires a lot of time and investment and it's harder to convince people to take chance on a complete newbie with their money for ads. So either work under someone who's experienced, cuz u will learn it faster in a practical setting, message a top freelancer and offer to assist them in their work and in return you'll sit through their strategy discussion on how to choose creatives etc etc, it's a whole different area but within 3-4 months you'll be very much capable of landing your own clients.  \nStart on Fiverr or Upwork for the above.\n\nFor smaller side income while you build the main thing, survey and PTE apps can get you $200-250/month. I use Prolific and Babki. It's not much but it helps while you're ramping up the bigger income sources, and esp. with surveys once you get consistent and start getting invites to better surveys, it's a solid source of extra income for some people.\n\nAll in all pick one main skill to learn and freelance it. Don't try to do 10 different things at once or you won't get good at any of them.\n\nAlso it depends on things that you may naturally be good at, so spend time figuring that out",

      "selftext": "Ninety days ago, I hit publish without a plan.\n\nNo niche.  \nNo funnel.  \nNo clear outcome.\n\nJust a promise to myself:\n\n**Write every day. Tell the truth. See what happens.**\n\nHere is what actually happened.\n\n\n\n## 1. Consistency Is the Real Differentiator\n\nIdeas are everywhere.  \nMotivation fades fast.\n\nShowing up every day is rare.\n\nMost newsletters die after five issues.  \nSome after ten.  \nAlmost none survive boredom.\n\nWriting daily forces momentum. Even bad days count. Especially bad days.\n\nMomentum compounds quietly.\n\n\n\n## 2. You Do Not Need a Niche to Start\n\nI wrote about:\n- Games  \n- Debt  \n- Kids  \n- AI  \n- Side hustles  \n- Being tired  \n- Being lost  \n\nPeople still subscribed.\n\nWhy? Because clarity comes later.  \nVoice comes first.\n\nYour niche finds you while you show up.\n\n\n\n## 3. Honesty Beats Polish Every Time\n\nThe most replies came from emails where I admitted:\n- I was stuck  \n- I was broke  \n- I did not know what to build next  \n- I was exhausted  \n\nPerfect writing gets skimmed.  \nHonest writing gets read.\n\nPeople do not connect with success.  \nThey connect with struggle in motion.\n\n\n## 4. Writing Creates Direction You Cannot Think Your Way Into\n\nBefore the newsletter, my head was noisy.\n\nToo many ideas.  \nToo many directions.\n\nWriting forced decisions.\n\nEvery sentence clarified what mattered.  \nEvery issue narrowed the signal.\n\nAction creates clarity. Not the other way around.\n\n\n## 5. You Learn What Resonates Only by Publishing\n\nI thought some topics would hit. They did nothing.\n\nI wrote throwaway thoughts that sparked replies, shares, and signups.\n\nYou cannot predict resonance from your head.\n\nYou discover it in public.\n\n\n\n## 6. Momentum Is Fragile. Protect It Aggressively\n\nSkipping one day feels harmless.\n\nIt is not.\n\nSkipping breaks the streak.  \nBreaking the streak kills momentum.  \nMomentum is everything.\n\nSome days I wrote at 3 AM.  \nSome days I wrote tired.  \nSome days I wrote with nothing interesting to say.\n\nThose days mattered most.\n\n\n\n## 7. Writing Builds Trust Before It Makes Money\n\nNinety days in, I did not get rich.\n\nBut something better happened.\n\nPeople trusted me.\n\nThey replied.  \nThey asked questions.  \nThey shared ideas.  \nThey followed my projects.\n\nTrust is the asset.  \nMoney follows trust.\n\n\n\n## 8. Your Life Is Content If You Pay Attention\n\nI stopped hunting for ideas.\n\nLife provided them.\n\n- A bike ride  \n- A sick kid  \n- A failed product  \n- A small win  \n- A bad day  \n\nYou do not need inspiration.  \nYou need awareness.\n\n\n## 9. Building in Public Keeps You Accountable\n\nWhen people expect tomorrow’s email, quitting gets harder.\n\nThat pressure is good.\n\nIt turned writing into a habit instead of a mood.\n\nAccountability creates endurance.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Ninety Days Is Just the Beginning\n\nNothing magical happens on day ninety.\n\nNo finish line.  \nNo sudden clarity.  \nNo overnight win.\n\nBut something shifts.\n\nWriting becomes normal.  \nSharing becomes easier.  \nConfidence grows quietly.\n\nYou stop asking, “Should I keep going?”\n\nYou just keep going.\n\nI don't plan on stopping. Look for another update in 90 days when I hit 180 days of writing a daily newsletter! \n\nComment below any questions i'll answer them all! \n\n\n",

I'm worried about getting scammed or dealing with returns when someone says it stopped working.   \n  \nThen I look at furniture, decor, vintage kitchen stuff etc. Seems like way less competition and people will pay surprisingly good money for the right pieces. Just saw someone in my area sell a mid century dresser for like $300. Downside is obviously you can't ship a couch and storage becomes an issue fast. My garage is already pretty full lol  \n  \nDoes anyone have experience with both? Like if you had to pick one lane which would actually be more profitable long term? I've got maybe $300-400 to invest upfront if that matters. Also doing this part time so I can't be spending 8 hours a day sourcing or whatever  \n  \nWould really appreciate any advice from people who've been doing this for a while!!",

Price $50-$100 per task.\n3. **Turn repeat work into a bundle** (templates + checklist) and sell it on Whop for passive sales.\n4. **Batch once a week** (2-3 hrs) so it doesn’t bleed into family time.\n5. **Upsell retainers** after 2-3 jobs for predictable monthly income.\n\nThis avoids ads, cold calls, and heavy setup - just focused, repeatable wins from home.",

I'm trying to work on that currently). I have work experience in customer service and hospitality. I've managed a coffee shop.

Give us specifics on the steps you took for each of these:\n\n* selling your art\n* Amazon KDP low-content books\n* POD\n* selling stuff online\n\nI've found from personal experience that all the things I \"failed at\" were things I didn't actually follow through on. \n\nLike - when I first started a blog (back in 2008, when you literally could get monetized after a couple of weeks just writing about a game on your iphone), I got approved for AdSense, then got bored and abandoned it instead of finding a niche I actually loved and sticking with it. So ... no millions from AdSense.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Affiliate - wrote a few blog posts and gave up because it wasn't converting \"fast enough\" for my liking. Guess what? If I'd done even ONE BF promo or a \"gift ideas for Christmas\" kind of post and *promoted it*, I'd have made enough to make me stick with it. So ... no millions from Amazon Affiliate.\n\nGot approved for Amazon Merch .... same story.\n\nDo you see the pattern here? It's not enough to START. You need to stick with something long enough to give it time to work, rather than giving up after a short while. \n\nPick a thing. Anything. Figure out how to get it online. \n\n***Do some actual promotion.*** &lt;- Without this, no online venture can succeed these days, there's just TOO much noise out there. So you'll need to put money into ads (the quickest way to get people to see what you're selling, and to buy, but you risk spending a lot of money if you don't know what you're doing and don't keep an eagle eye on that ad spend). Or you'll need to spend money figuring out how else to get discovered - either by posting regularly or by partnering with someone who does know what they're doing and can get you sales.\n\nYouTube can help you figure out where you're stumbling in a particular venture. Can help you get past the obstacles. More than any course you can buy, you'll learn by actually DOING the thing and figuring out how to get past the roadblocks. And there are roadblocks in everything we try that is new to us.\n\nGood luck. If you stick with something long enough, I can promise you you'll learn enough to make it work.",

          "body": "I'm not sure what you meant by selling your art, but if it was on Etsy, that's a LONG game. And even then, you're not guaranteed to be seen with all the other million of sellers. The people that do best on Etsy are the ones with a good social media following. \n\nI've been selling on Etsy since 2014 and it's not a big money maker for me. Partly because I can't scale my handmade items even if they did catch on. But I make enough to keep me going, giving me a small profit for a small bit of work.\n\nI don't have a social media presence, but I do okay. It took from 2014 - 2017 of learning Etsy SEO (which is not at all like Google SEO or eBay SEO), finding what works in my niche, oh and the biggie is to **have a niche**. Can you say exactly what your art is and identify a particular person and not generally 'people who have bulletin boards'? \n\nFor instance, I sell push pins, but my niche is Kawaii Cute style, and I only sell push pins.\n\nIf I need money, then selling things around the house on eBay is usually my best option, too. I was lucky my daughter was into collectibles figures, and even though (or because?) she played with them, they sold well. Sometimes I go to charity shops and find Barbie or My Little Pony things and those sell well. Even when selling on eBay, get a niche. Niches sell better than just throwing things up. When I sell on eBay it's usually toys. And because of that I now have an eye for what toys sell.\n\nIf I went around and just bought random things, I'd have more misses (things that don't sell) than hits with fast selling items.\n\nPeople are not making millions with PDFs unless the PDF is in a specific niche that people need.\n\nOn Etsy, there is a person that does make a lot of money with Excel spreadsheets. But she is very good with Excel and is able to do good customer service since she understands Excel and how people will mess up the formulas.  She can also customize the Excel spreadsheets for what Etsy sellers need. \n\nIf you have a strength that someone needs for their business, then that's the way to go. Her shop is successful (in my opinion) due to word of mouth. When I see on Etsy seller forums someone asking for accounting help, they will mention this shop and say they liked her forms. These cost about $100 each, but people buy them because she is good at what she does.\n\nPOD is always tough, even if you have your own artwork. There are so much POD shirts (etc) that it's hard to get seen. At one time (Etsy has been cracking down a little bit on this) people would buy a design on CreativeFabrica and without changing a thing stick it on a POD shirt. At one time if you looked up Be Kind t-shirt you'd see over 1,000 listings of the exact same \"Be Kind\" with Boho rainbow in the same colors, all the listings one after another. This made Etsy search a bit boring, so Etsy did crack down and reminded people that the seller has to change the design significantly enough for it to be unique. \n\nEven so, POD is not the road to riches. One youtuber showed how much he made with POD shirts. With advertising (which he said he needed) he made $1.00 for each shirt. Without Advertising he made something like $3 or so on POD shirts. When he started printing his own shirts in his garage he ended up with about $10 profit from each shirt, but as you can imagine that is a lot of work. \n\nNow he is an Etsy Coach. I don't even think that is the way to riches, but it pays better than POD. It takes a lot to get seen in that area as well. \n\nMy thoughts: you have to be fantastic at marketing (or at least find your audience somewhere like on TikTok or Pinterest) and have an equally fantastic product. But then, sometimes foreign manufacturers (or even Michaels, the craft store) will see it, copy it and mass produce it for pennies on the dollar. I do better at my 9-5 (despite what Etsy coaches say) than I do in my Etsy shop.\n\nMy reliable \"side hustle\" is Fetch Rewards. It's not much, though. I probably average enough points every 3 months for a $50 gift card. The games have the most points, not the receipts. \n\nI consider my Etsy shop more like a part time job. It doesn't bring in much, there are no benefits, but I'm always on call to answer customer questions. Not what I call a side hustle. 😋\n\nGood luck!",

      "selftext": "Flip stuff on Facebook marketplace or Craigslist. It's surprisingly easy to find decent prices on stuff. I did this for a stint between jobs and it was surprisingly effective.  Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\nUse [warehousewatcher.com](http://warehousewatcher.com) to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first.\nAnother excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n Places like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)\n\n\n\n\nIt just occured to me to post this after several friends and family just told me they were tossing out perfectly new stuff because it was \"taking up space\". I told them to list it on marketplace and it literally just never occurred to them that they could do that. Just in case others are in the same habit, thought I'd bring it up.",

      "selftext": "back in 2020 when everything was locked down and everyone suddenly became an “online entrepreneur,” I tried to do the same. I had way too much time, way too many tabs open, and zero idea what would actually work. I remember picking one simple niche, throwing together a small site, and writing a few pages just based on stuff I was already googling myself. no grand plan, just “if I’m confused about this, someone else probably is too.”\n\nthe mistake I made early was expecting fast results. every day I’d check traffic like it was a heartbeat monitor. nothing. weeks went by and it felt dead. instead of scrapping it, I left it alone because honestly I was tired of starting over. that turned out to be the accidental win. while I was distracted with other things, that little site slowly started getting search traffic.\n\nthe first time a commission showed up, I thought it was a reporting error. it was small, but it felt unreal because I hadn’t done anything that day. then it happened again a week later. that’s when I understood what people meant by “passive” — not no work, just work done earlier finally paying rent.\n\n**Takeaway:** 2020 taught me that most online stuff doesn’t need brilliance, it needs time. if something is useful and you don’t kill it too early, it has a chance to surprise you later.",

I sleep randomly, wake up randomly whether at 2am or in the afternoon, and life is basically either laptop or bed. \n\nAnd this is all to ensure 100% client satisfaction. \n\nBecause I understand that building a strong relationship is the real goal and not the money. \n\nI've been doing this for a while anyway. \n\nBut this workload paired with exams coming up, even though I practically attend college for vibes at this point, and in general me being relatively young and already living alone at 20 is seriously driving me insane. \n\nWhen I heard entrepreneurs say that building and starting a business is hard, I never thought it could actually be THIS ridiculously hard. \n\nBut here I am wishing I was just some good boy who's only concern is his GPA. \n\nBut there's no going back now and I have no regrets. \n\nTo those that run a business solo... How do you do it? And how do you deal specifically with pressure and stress? \n\nThanks. ",

I did this for a stint between jobs and it was surprisingly effective. \n\n\n Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.\n\n\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to within 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

So the idea was, DO THIS HARD WORK for X amount of time, THEN enjoy the benefits of that work LONG after its made.\n\nBut new people, like OP, started coming into this space, or learned of this term without knowing the history of the term, and began critiquing others using the word properly.",

I had 217 items listed for sale and my sales totaled close to $14k, my expenses totaled $400, and I averaged 2 hours weekly. I did have a week where I put in 17 hours but that was for an IT issue and had to touch over a 100 products.",

Current age for anyone qualifying to go this is age 65. So you could start your draw a pension 5 years before you qualify to retire! \n\nUse the military to learn a new skill that can get you a better civilian job (heavy equip operator, heating/AC repair, plumbing, medical, ect. . .). \n\nIt gets even better if you do an initial 5 years active duty. I went active duty army at age 29 to break the min wage rut. I did 5 active and then entered the civilian job market to a good job. \n\nYou can also get GI bill (education &amp; house), tuition assistance and discount shopping. There is no tax on items purchased on base (great for big items). \n\nI started collecting my military pension at age 60 and got tricare health insurance ($900 a year for me &amp; my wife). At age 65 it turns into tricare for life and is free. It works with Medicare and eliminates our co-Pays. \n\nMy military pension for part time work is $3K a month. I used my weekend drill money to invest and those investments return another $4K-$6K a month.\n\nIf you start at age 30, and put $7K ($581 a month) a year into a Roth IRA at age 65, you would have $730K. At 6% that would give you $45K a year extra/$3800 a month income. Start earlier and it can reach $1 million! Drop your income to $3000 a month and grow your principe so it is inflation proof. \n\nWhere else will a side hustle/part time job return $7K-$9K a month in retirement? I now make 3-4 times what I ever made working!",

          "body": "I think you’ve confused the phrase passive income with something more along the lines of passive employment. No, of course there’s no way to earn money without putting in work. There is no such thing as a passive job. Passive income represents money you earn while you sleep. By your logic, not even investing is true passive income because:\n1) the money still needed to be earned one way or another.\n2) someone is still out there actively managing that investment (whether it is you or a broker)\n\nSo, if someone invests upfront time and costs into a vending machine business that needs to be emptied and stocked (say once a month), the entire month that it’s not being actively stocked or emptied it is earning you passive income. I would argue that vending machines are a source of TRUE passive income since they can’t be use while being filled…\n\nThe same maintenance schedule can be applied to buying and selling stocks. Once you invest that first initial time, or any subsequent time if you buy and/or sell, it becomes active, but while it sits there, it is passive.\n\nOnce you make and upload a YouTube video, it can now bring in passive income (in theory; popularity and many other factors play a big role). Once production is done, the video needs little/no maintenance to continue to get views and have earning potential. Sure, you have to put in work to make the videos and set up ads or whatever you need to do, but each video you make and upload creates its own stream of passive income.",

Even if something still needs your involvement to really take off, if sales or revenues or whatever can theoretically come without your direct involvement, that’s technically passive income.\n\nFor example, I am an author. I recently published a middle grade / young adult superhero novel. I have it available as an ebook to buy or read on Kindle Unlimited, and the paperbacks are available via Print on Demand. I’m still at the point where I have to do a TON of marketing work for each sale as I am a brand new unknown author, but each sale occurs without my input. Someone could be purchasing my book right now and I have nothing to do with that directly. That’s passive income. I CAN make sales even when I’m not directly involved.\n\nCompare that to if I brought a couple dozen copies of my book to a book festival to sell. That would be active income. Not because it’s harder or more work, but because I am personally involved in each sale. I am personally speaking to the customer, taking their money, putting the book into a bag, etc. It’s active income because it fundamentally requires my involvement; if I were to pack my books up and leave, the sales stop. This has nothing to do with me not being well known yet. It’s just how it works.\n\nThe issue is that people hear “passive” and they watch all the finance bro passive income YouTubers shilling their crypto shitcoins, and they think that it means no work. A phrase I heard a decade ago that I always tell people is “passive income does NOT denote passive activity”. There are active income streams that involve far less work than some passive income streams. That doesn’t change the fundamental income mechanisms that make them active of passive income.\n\n\n\nBy the way, if anyone’s looking for a book to give to a tween, teen, or young adult (or any age) book or superhero lover, I can post a link to it. 🙃 See?

You already know your favorite retailer’s patterns. Patterns are important. If you have a retirement plan then you can see how they swing trade as well. Even drug dealers buy low and sell high.\n\n2. Sales - Learn to sell times right way. Power of persuasion is a valuable tool. Works a million times better when you are actually selling to folks with good intent. \n\n3. Learn to Earn - Lets make one fact clear: money does not exist. You must work for everything special and terrible in life. That’s part of the plan. The knowledge you take in and translate that to action is a major building block in your journey.\n\nWhen you’re out shopping, make sure to comb through the clearance section of every store you go to you. What can you resell? Plan trips for thrifting and garage sales. I still do that.\n\nThe process of you putting in the time planning and executing great strategies coupled with who you meet is priceless.\n\nWhen you go to a new town on vacation or just stopping by, place yourself as a person that is planning on moving there and speak to people. Actually listen to what they say, suggest, what they do for a living, etc… Build relationships. Travel as much as you can.\n\nI can go on and on since I have done so much in my life to create “passive income”.\n\nWork hard, and do it with great intent and you will make 80% of your adventures work out.\n\nWhen you see or come up with a new idea, attack it passionately to see if it will work.

The guarantee is closer to 3% treasury bills, move the risk meter away from that and the potential yield and risk move higher. It's manageable risk. Things like the rule of 72, compounding, drip and dca are things that investors all know to literally grow money passively.",

          "body": "IMO, there isn’t really a single “skill” that leads to passive income. What works is learning how to package something you’re good at and getting it in front of the right people.\n\nThat “something” can sit anywhere on a spectrum:\n\n\t•Services (tutoring, proofreading, childcare) → more active, easier to start\n\n\t•Digital products (printables, templates) → create once, sell repeatedly\n\n\t•Content/affiliates → slower burn, more scalable\n\nServices usually require more hands-on effort, but they’re a great entry point. For example, tutoring or kids’ activities are best marketed in parent spaces — PTA groups, school newsletters, community boards, libraries, coffee shops near schools, etc.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I made cootie catchers out of flyers advertising myself as a mother’s helper and handed them out at our community pool. My mom shared them through PTA connections. That’s not advanced marketing — it’s just knowing where your audience already is and when they’re mentally open to noticing your offer.\n\nPrintables sit closer to the “passive” end. You create them once (worksheets, planners, kids’ activities) and sell them repeatedly on sites like Etsy. But it’s saturated, so discovery still matters. You don’t need to be a marketing expert — just understand the basics of SEO, algorithms, and when /your/ audience is active.\n\nIf you’re product- or lifestyle-focused (beauty, fashion, fitness, home), affiliate links (Amazon, LTK, “link in bio”) are another route. Same principle, different channel.\n\nThe closest thing to passive income comes after upfront effort: build once, market intentionally, then let systems and word of mouth take over.",

I found one today with $500 for $1000 (I’ve never seen one this profitable before). \n\nCheck terms &amp; conditions, but usually you need to play it through once prior to redeeming. Playing 2 separate instances of the same live roulette channel ($49 on black at casino x on your phone; $49 at casino y on laptop; 1-2 on 0) you end up with 98%. YouTuber profitable gambler posted instruction &amp; has a discord too. \n\nYou can also collect daily bonuses of .20 - $1.00  at 20+ websites until you have enough to cross wash (gamble) &amp; redeem. They offer intermittent bonuses similar to welcome ones too. \n\nI don’t know how long these will be around. A few states banned them already. It’s an easy side hustle rn.",

          "body": "Hitting \\~$100/day is doable, but it’s less about finding something “fully passive” on day one and more about setting up systems that become passive over time.\n\nWith your budget and being tech-savvy, I’d look at things that scale without trading hours for dollars. Stuff like content + monetization (blogs, YouTube, niche sites), simple digital products, or automation-friendly services. For example, niche websites with affiliate links or ads can start slow but compound once they rank. Same with YouTube or Shorts tied to a clear niche.\n\nAnother solid path is building or licensing something small but useful, like templates, scripts, prompts, Notion setups, or simple tools. You put the work in upfront, then sell it repeatedly. Even $10–$20 products don’t need many sales per day to hit that goal.\n\nReselling and arbitrage can work too, but it’s usually less passive and more operational. Good for cash flow, not always for freedom.\n\nThe biggest mistake is chasing “set it and forget it” from day one. Most things need a few weeks or months of effort before they level off. Pick one thing, commit to it, and optimize instead of jumping between ideas. That’s usually what gets people to consistent $100 days.",

      "selftext": "Over the last few years I tried pretty much every hustle you see on YouTube: Amazon FBA, low-content books, faceless YouTube, affiliate blogs, even a couple of drop-servicing sites. Made little spikes of income here and there, nothing sustainable, nothing I could confidently grow.\n\nWhat finally started working was treating one thing like an actual product business instead of a quick win. I’d been curious about SaaS but assumed it was too “serious” compared to easy hustles. The only reason I even tried was seeing a bunch of small, bootstrapped SaaS case studies in [foundertoolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) that started from where I was: no audience, no funding, just skills and time. The difference with this route was that the first dollars I made were from people paying monthly for something that actually solved a problem, not a one-off trick. I followed a validation and launch sequence I found there: weekend idea tests, pre-sell a tiny group, launch across 20+ small channels instead of only one big platform, then commit to a few months of content to keep traffic coming.\n\nMy first product is nothing crazy. It’s a simple niche tool solving one specific workflow headache. MRR is just over $1,200 right now, but psychologically it’s a different world from one-time hustles. Revenue comes in every month without having to constantly find new buyers from scratch. The biggest surprise was realizing I didn’t need some viral idea or massive audience, just a boring, well-executed system. Seeing dozens of people turn that system into $1–10K MRR made it feel less like a gamble and more like a skill I could learn. It’s still work, but it finally feels like I’m building an asset instead of chasing the next tactic.",

That’s where most people quit. I’ve seen folks do similar using Indie Hackers, small subreddits, Product Hunt, plus tools like Lemlist and Ahrefs to find and reach tiny pockets of users. I use Feedly, Google Alerts, and Pulse alongside that to track where those users are actually complaining so I can join those exact threads instead of screaming into the void.\n\n\n\nBottom line: boring recurring systems beat flashy one-off hustles every time.",

Build a “semi-passive” site + paid traffic for validation\n\nInstead of waiting for SEO:\n\nPick one boring but profitable niche (finance tools, SaaS, health accessories, B2B services)\n\nBuild 20 high-intent pages\n\nSpend $500–$1k testing Google or Pinterest traffic\nOnce you find pages that convert → scale or hand off.\n\n\n3.

          "body": "Maybe reselling textbooks online? Some mass book stores sell books for cheap, so cheap that it might come off sketchy to consumers. You could buy some of the cheaper books and up charge them when reselling. Like I saw a book online for $20, that cost $200 at like Walmart. As long as they are more affordable than the brand new copies, and you build a reputable reputation, people might pay more than the cheapest option if they know that they can trust the seller.\n\nYou could work with college students, because colleges tend to upcharge a crazier amount than regular stores. (Literally got my college to lower their textbook price by $200 just because a local store had it $200 cheaper.) (Make sure to take plenty of pictures of the textbooks, so the consumers know what they are getting.)",

Today.\nExamples that convert fast:\n\nSimple design (Canva thumbnails, resumes, IG posts)\n\nWriting (product descriptions, captions, rewriting AI text)\n\nTech help (website fixes, setup, basic automation)\n\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert. You need to solve one small problem and price it clearly.\n\n2. Price for speed, not perfection\n$100–$200 offers move faster than $10 ones.\n5 people paying $200 = you’re basically there.\n\nMost people fail because they underprice and overwork.\n\n3. Go where buyers already are (don’t “build an audience”)\n\nReddit (help-first replies, no pitching)\n\nFacebook groups\n\nTwitter/X replies\n\nLocal businesses that already spend money\n\n\nOne solid message to the right person beats 100 posts.\n\n4. Sell something digital once if you’re short on time If you can package knowledge you already have into:\n\na short guide\n\nchecklist\n\nstep-by-step system\n\n\nYou can sell it multiple times without extra work. This is how people hit very specific numbers fast.\n\nI struggled with the same “I need money now” pressure, so I wrote a short, practical guide breaking down:\n\nwhat actually converts fast\n\nhow to price so people say yes\n\nwhere to post without sounding salesy\n\n\nNot hype, just execution.

What is actually working for everyone else here because I am tired of seeing posts about dropshipping and amazon fba like those are passive when they are clearly not",

One is to invest money and two is to have a business that gives you money. \n\nAfter that sure there are several small ways here and there but you will find that in order to actually generate considerable income you would either have to spend money or make a business, or both.\n\nIf you have around 300k in stocks you could make around 90k every 3 years approximately which is around 10%, and that if the stocks make sense. I suppose you don’t have that money so what’s left is actually building a business that you could automate later on, but even then, the minute something goes wrong, it turns to active income.\n\nIn other words, you either have a capital upfront (stocks, property even, etc) and make money on returns or you either  build a business that holds value and lasts.

Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n2.\t⁠once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n3.\t⁠once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course.\n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you.\n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for.

Sent them weekly reports showing underperforming units, rent optimization opportunities, maintenance spending alerts, market comparisons against similar properties in their area. All 3 offered to pay immediately after first report, didn't even finish the trial period.\n\nBuilt it into a service at $99/month. “How is this a passive income?” I use leni to automate the analysis work and get all the necessary insights fast. No manual hours per cliet, which would've also made this impossible to scale. Now at 47 subscribers which is $4,653/month.

          "body": "If anything, learn a hard skill/career that you can practice and make money solely on. Writing, video editing, digital marketing, web development. It's best to focus on one, but you will likely find yourself having to do other things around it, which does give a good platform for later on should you wish to go down those routes. \n\nStart with those and build around it, a lot of the less tangible skills will come through your own understanding and maturity. For instance, copywriting requires the ability to research, and also doing it to create your own understanding (especially now with AI lowering the bar a bit). \n\nI started with writing articles, and that led me into copywriting. I learned how SEO worked, how to monetise blogs and websites, how to communicate with potential clients. That's just one line of work, but it's just an example of how you can branch out your skills and insight the further you go. \n\nIt's better to start slow and steady as well with these, go into it with the idea of becoming good at what you do, rather than making money. The competition is massive online, but excelling and standing out is what gives longevity from my experience. Most of my opportunities have come from people seeing the quality of my work and the results, rather than me having to hard sell to them. \n\nAlso, you should consider attitudes more than anything. Be patient, put the effort in, don't make shortcuts and become resilient. It takes time to get anywhere reasonable, and you need to temper your expectations at times, but the success cut through eventually and that's what you need to focus on.\n\nEdit: Just realised this was the passive income sub, not the one I thought it was. A lot of this still rings true, but focus on a niche you're interested in and build something around that. You can practice skills easily, you will understand the market/industry/topic better and you will have an easier time getting the ball rolling.",

I’m nowhere near quitting my day job, but it’s solid extra income I can work on in my spare time while building a catalog of content that keeps selling.\n\nIt’s adult ebooks. NSFW. Turns out there’s real demand.\n\nI sell across multiple storefronts and slowly build a reader base that follows my work. About half of my process uses AI, but the other half is creativity and editing. If you rely only on AI, you get buried in low-quality content fast.\n\nThis is very niche, and most people don’t make much. But it is possible. From what I’ve seen, there are quite a few people doing very well in this space.\n\nI also sell custom stories. They take more work, even with partial AI assistance, but I’ve made almost $2,000 this year from just five of those commissions.\n\nEdit: I learned everything through authormeta.com (the Erotica Author QuickStart Guide)",

It’s usually work now, lighter work later.\n\nThat said, here are the most realistic options people actually make work:\n\nDigital products\nGuides, templates, checklists, simple tools. You do the work once, then improve it over time. Not instant, but repeatable.\n\nContent + affiliates\nWriting posts, answering questions, or making short content that links to tools you genuinely use. Slow at first, compounds later.\n\nRoyalties / licensing\nStock photos, music, designs, or assets. Very competitive, but low maintenance once uploaded.\n\nAutomation of an active skill\nTurning something you already do (freelancing, consulting, teaching) into a template, resource, or product.\n\n\nAnything that claims “fully passive with no effort” is usually just selling the idea, not the income.\n\nIn my experience, the closest thing to passive income comes from building something small that keeps working even when you’re not actively chasing people.\n\nCurious what others here consider “passive”.

      "selftext": "I posted this to another sub and got some really good insights. I kind of wanted to see if anyone on this sub had something else to add.\n\nA few months ago, I started seeing some posts in my Instagram feed about the massive potential of making money EASILY by selling digital products (courses, PDFs, ebooks) and promoting them on Instagram. \n\nI wasn’t desperate for money or trying to escape a job I hated. I just thought it might be a reasonable way to bring in some extra income to help with my tuition. The way it was framed made it sound low effort and practical. I figured: what the hell? For a few hours a day, it seems lucrative enough.\n\nI also didn’t want to start by creating my own products, so I went the route they all recommend at the beginning. I bought 2 of these MRR courses that you can resell. I spent hundreds of dollars thinking it would pay off and that I was being smart by skipping the hard part and getting courses i can resell instead of spending time and effort creating sth from scratch (also one of their selling points). Looking back, that was incredibly naive.\n\nIt's really frustrating how misleading the whole thing is. They never talk about how time consuming it actually is to create content consistently, figure out the algorithms, write captions, film videos, edit, post, engage on Instagram. It is not a side hustle. It is a very demanding business.. Not to mention the fact that Instagram is soo random sometimes with how it pushes content. So you're basically stuck performing for the algorithm like a puppet.\n\nThey also make it feel so urgent!! If you don’t start now, you’ll be too late. If you don’t buy the course today, you’re missing your chance. That pressure is constant and intentional.\n\nAnd then there are the hidden costs. The DM automation tools, the monthly storefront fees for Stan or Beacon, and all the other monthly subscriptions that somehow never get mentioned upfront. It adds up quickly, especially for something that is marketed as low risk and easy.\n\nTo top ot off, these people selling courses act like they figured it out overnight. In reality, they took months or years to build an audience and credibility. But that part is quietly skipped over while they sell the idea that anyone can do this fast with minimal effort.\n\nI’m not saying no one makes money doing this. I’m just saying the way it’s marketed is incredibly deceptive and preys on people’s vulnerability and optimism. I really wish I had figured this all out before I spent money on this! I feel disillusioned and cheated by this whole scheme. Now I don't even want to pursue this any further because I now fully understand how time-consuming and unpredictable Instagram can be, even though I dropped a lot of money expecting an easy side hustle!\n\nYou might be wondering why I even ventured into this in the first place. I obviously fell for their empty promises and false hope. I also went into this hoping for an \"easy\" way to make money, and I was genuinely clueless enough to actually think thus would be simple and effortless. But that's on me!!\n\nThat’s it. I just needed to vent. I'm not playing martyr and I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just needed an outlet and to see how many other people made the same mistake I did. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk 😅 ",

After two weeks of minimal engagement, I realized that rushing to sell something without offering true value only left me feeling more defeated. Eventually, when I took the time to connect with my audience, asking them about their challenges and sharing useful insights, I saw a significant shift in engagement. My response rate went from 2% to around 15%, and it felt meaningful again. Have you had any moments where connecting personally with potential customers made a difference for you?",

What you described is the part of “passive income” people almost never talk about — not freedom yachts, but stability when your brain just won’t cooperate.\n\nThe way you framed it, building for your worst days instead of your best ones, is honestly the smartest strategy I’ve heard. It explains why digital products work so well when they’re done right. You’re not selling hype, you’re selling relief, clarity, or a shortcut you wish you’d had yourself.\n\nAnd the fact that it compounds quietly is huge. No algorithms to chase, no being “on,” no pressure to perform when you’re already drained. Just something useful living out there doing its job.\n\nI think a lot of people underestimate how powerful that model is, especially for creators who deal with anxiety, burnout, or inconsistent energy. You proved that you don’t need to be loud, visible, or constantly present to build something meaningful and sustainable.\n\nReally glad you shared this — it’s motivating in a very grounded, real way.",

The role is explained, the responsibilities are listed, the culture is highlighted. But the pay is missing.\n\nSalary info matters. It helps applicants quickly understand if the role is realistic for them. It saves time for both sides. It allows candidates to honestly evaluate what they can bring to the table and decide if the role is worth pursuing.\n\nEven if you can’t share the exact amount, at least include a salary range. That alone gives clarity. From there, applicants can choose to move forward and negotiate if they believe they can deliver more value.\n\nNo one wants to go through multiple interviews only to find out the offer doesn’t align with expectations. Transparency from the start builds trust and attracts the right people.\n\nApplicants deserve clarity. And companies benefit from it too.",

      "selftext": "I \"just started\" my site a little over three months ago. It is my first real project. Had an idea for a specialized newsletter/content product/saas-sorta-thing and it turned out to be a very nice niche.   \n  \nEndless keywords to target, very little competition, and content that I can easily scrape and aggregate into programmatic pages that stay fresh.\n\nSome rough numbers so far: \n\n* 250 pages published\n   * Each page is refreshed weekly on average\n* 90% of submitted pages indexed\n* L90 days: 1500 clicks / 1.5M impr\n* L7 days: 250 clicks / 250k impr\n   * Low CTR due to lots of obvious bot activity - many 0 click keywords with big impressions in my GSC\n* 19 DR per ahrefs. A few directory submissions to get things going and \\~10 nice organic citations\n* 150 \"user\"/newsletter signups\n\nI am happy with this progress given it is early days. There is so much more content that can be generated. I should also be able to get more momentum going when I can give more focus: I've spent only about 3-4 hours/week on it since the site has been up and running.\n\nOn one hand, I am glad that I thought about things long enough to land on this niche. On the other, I regret not getting going sooner! I was probably subscribed to this sub for at least a year or two, just sitting on the sidelines. \n\nIf you're like me and wanting to \"just start\", I couldn't recommend it more! At the very least, you will learn a lot. Best case, you will stumble onto something even bigger than you thought it would be. Regardless, you will get yourself in the mix with the power to navigate and pivot your way to success.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched a French travel blog in early October (2.5 months ago) documenting a month-long Brazil trip with comprehensive destination guides (Paraty, Ilha Grande, Rio, Petropolis, Belo Horizonte, Ouro Preto, São Paulo). Each page has detailed day-by-day itineraries, restaurant recommendations, transportation tips, and real pricing based on actual experiences.\n\n**Technical foundation:**\n\n* 100/100 Lighthouse score for SEO\n* Multilingual setup (FR/EN/ES/DE - French primary)\n* Mostly original photos, only authentic content (AI-assisted writing though)\n* Clean site structure with XML sitemap\n\n**Current situation:**\n\n* Almost no traffic yet on Google Analytics (expected for a new site, but still humbling!)\n* Building Pinterest presence (batch-creating pins, themed boards)\n* Planning monetization with Booking, SafetyWing, GetYourGuide affiliates\n* Considering supplementary content pages (just \"Survival Portuguese for Brazil\" and \"Budget\" pages so far)\n\n**Questions for experienced travel bloggers/SEO specialists:**\n\n1. **Content strategy:** Should I focus on creating more supplementary pages (how to plan your trip, fun facts, packing lists, playlist, video list ...) or double down on promoting existing destination content?\n2. **Traffic channels:** For travel niches in 2025, what's the realistic timeline and ROI for:\n   * Pinterest (I'm hearing 2-3 months?)\n   * Other platforms worth prioritizing?\n3. **Keyword approach:** Should I be doing specific keyword targeting for each page, or is having clear titles and relevant content enough? If targeting is necessary, should I go for broad terms like \"Brazil itinerary\" or hyper-specific like \"best restaurants Paraty colonial center\"?\n4. **Monetization timing:** Build traffic first then add affiliate links, or implement them now? I'm concerned about looking too promotional early on.\n\nI know travel blogging is highly competitive, so I'm trying to be strategic rather than just hoping for the best. Any advice from those who've successfully grown travel blogs would be hugely appreciated!",

Long messages, Robotic replies, Same flow for every follower, People can tell when they’re being “processed.”\n\nThe funnels that worked best were: Short messages, Natural language, One clear purpose per step\n\nAutomation should feel like a helpful assistant, not a chatbot \n\n&gt;Real use cases I’ve seen work\n\nDifferent creators, same principle:\nCoaches → book calls from story replies\nEducators → sell digital products via keywords\nInfluencers → qualify brand leads\nAgency owners → pre-filter inbound DMs\n\nNo hard selling.\nJust structured conversations.\n\n&gt;The biggest mindset shift\n\nCreators don’t need: More content, More posting More followers, They need better conversations.\n\nOnce the DM flow was set up properly: Replies didn’t go cold, Buyers identified themselves, Sales felt natural, not forced\n\nIf you’re a creator reading this\n\nIf you’re getting: \n“Interested”\n“How much?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\n…but nothing happens after that\nyour problem isn’t your content.\n\nIt’s the lack of a system behind the DM.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break down an example flow if helpful.\nNot selling anything here just sharing what actually worked.\n",

When it’s your own thing, the customers you keep are the ones you actually like working with, and you can design the work to minimize the interactions you hate. That alone makes it feel way lighter, even if the money isn’t crazy.\n\nThe downside is you end up wearing every hat, which can get exhausting in a different way. A lot of solo founders I know are fine with customers, but get burned out by the admin, follow-ups, and keeping everything straight.\n\nThat’s basically why we’re building Quorum (still beta).

At the beginning there’s momentum, ideas flying around, telling friends what you’re building. Then at some point it’s just you, your laptop and a long stretch of decisions no one else can really help you with.\n\nWhat surprised me is that the hard part isn’t motivation, it’s uncertainty. There’s no clear signal that you’re doing the right thing, just small indicators that might mean progress or might mean nothing. Some days you feel smart and capable, other days you wonder if you’re just confidently wrong. This really hit me recently when I was reviewing my numbers and remembered I have some money saved from rollingriches that gives me a bit of runway. Instead of feeling relieved, I felt the weight of responsibility. Every decision suddenly feels louder when it’s your own money, your own time, and no safety net telling you what to do next.\n\nI’m still committed, still building still learning but I didn’t expect the mental side to be this isolating. Curious how others deal with that quiet phase where you’re not failing, not winning, just grinding alone.",

That middle stretch where you're not crashing but not crushing it either, just existing in this weird limbo of \"am I building something real or wasting my time?\" That's the loneliest part because there's no external validation, no team to bounce ideas off, just you and your doubts on repeat.\n\nThe uncertainty is brutal. You're right that it's not about motivation, it's about not knowing if what you're doing even matters yet. And when it's your own money and time on the line, every small decision feels massive because there's no boss to blame or pivot away from.\n\nWhat helped me was finding other founders to talk to, not for advice but just to vent and hear that everyone else is also in the fog. Accountability groups, Twitter DMs, random coffee chats. Just knowing other people are grinding through the same quiet phase makes it feel less isolating. Also, celebrating tiny wins (even if they feel insignificant) helps break up the monotony.\n\nThe fact that you're still showing up and building means you're doing it right. The grind phase is the filter. Most people quit here. Keep going, you're not alone in feeling this way.",

And there are always ways to see if you are doing the right thing (listen to your users, get feedback earlier), and there are ways how to do right things instead of guessing: do only what you know your users want and ready to pay for. Never do if you are unsure, research first.\n\nAbout loneliness... I hear it over and over again... and it surprises me a lot. I dreamed about it when I was an employee: to be my own employer, decide what to do, when and why. And yes, I tell myself (therefore I'm kinda isolated too) but for some reason, I don't feel any isolation at all. Also, I have users that want this and that, which makes me feel less isolated.\n\nI'm talking about myself and you and many others are different and may feel really isolated. I may suggest you to  launch as soon as possible (even with a landing page before the real product launch), talk about your idea/product/website/whatever everywhere, get feedback as soon as possible - soon you will find people need your product/features and your isolation is gone. If not, and after publishing and talking you still feel isolated and lonely - maybe you picked up a wrong idea and people don't want to talk about it, to talk to you about it, discuss it, or suggest something to be implemented.\n\nAnyway, this stage is always presented but it 100% up to you to make it as short as possible.\n\nYeah, and one more hack: set up publicly or privately available metric page: users amount, or query or what else that show you: people use your product therefore they need you. I always look at my website and even if the first number is the same, the second number is bigger.\n\nGood luck!",

We get along well and we both want the same long term outcome. The part that keeps me up at night is the risk side. I already own property and most of my savings are tied up there while she does not have assets yet. To get this business off the ground I would likely need to put my property on the line through a mortgage or loan and that feels very different when it is not just my idea anymore. I am trying to be honest with myself about whether this is a business concern or a relationship concern or both.  \nFor founders who started something with a partner when one person had more to lose how did you think through risk and boundaries before moving forward.

But is anyone on Reddit going to convince you not to do this? \n\nWhat you should listen to is all the people saying don't risk your assets. **You absolutely do not need to finance this business.** That's why these businesses are so popular; there is no expensive barrier to entry. You can probably get everything you need for years on Facebook Marketplace from someone who tried to do this and got bored. Get a logo for $100, set up a Shopify site and you're set. The biggest expense will probably be market fees to sell your stuff locally. \n\nI'd encourage you and your GF to put in $1,000 each or whatever makes sense. Set up the LLC, get an account, business credit card (that you pay off every month). Do all that shit right and if it works, great. If it doesn't, you're fine. And if your relationship implodes, you're both fine. \n\nAlso, you two should have a little book club it'll be cute. Read these two especially: \n\n* Supermaker, this is Jamie Schmidt's story of going from farmer's market to billion-dollar cash out. It's inspirational but sanguine, she embodied scrappy early on and has a lot of good advice. \n\n* E-Myth Revisited, this is a book I recommend everyone who has or wants to have a business around making something.

But some don't and others make profitable side-gigs but not real companies.  \n\nYou're getting good feedback. Good feedback is irrelevant. Good sales are what matters. And sales beyond friends. You say local markets - not sure if you mean stores or farmer's markets. But keep those activities up. BUT you have to account for the value of the time for whoever is doing the marketing and sales. And whoever is doing the manufacturing. Pay that person what it would cost to hire a stranger for those jobs. Is there still profit? If not, it's a nice hobby. If there is plow all the profits back into the business - basically more marketing till you've maxed out your manufacturing capacity. Then spend some of that profit on ways to increase capacity a little bit. Then sell more till you max out that additional capacity etc. Keep this up till the profit is more than one of your day job income and you feel confident enough in the future to quit that job. But only one of you. \n\nAt some point you'll have to have an agreement who's going to be in charge of what activities, what decisions, what spending etc. Hash this out and WRITE IT DOWN. It may not be a legal agreement, but writing it will clarify your thinking and preserve your memory of what you agreed to. \n\nI would not put my property at risk at this point. I would not spend savings - unless I was prepared to lose it.",

Start small with money you can both afford to lose, treat it like a test phase, and see if the business actually works before anyone takes on debt or secures loans against assets. If the idea is good, it should survive a slower, lower risk start. If it can’t, that’s valuable information before things get serious.\n\nIt’s also worth having an honest conversation about boundaries and worst case scenarios now, not later. What happens if it fails, what happens if you break up, who owns what, and how decisions get made. That doesn’t mean you don’t trust each other, it just means you’re being grown about it.

A candle brand should be able to prove demand, margins, and repeat buyers without personal guarantees or mortgages. Try making small batches, do not invest too much into something that is an experiment in it's essence. Also, starting a new business with your family members - better get ready for never having a place to unwind. Sometimes it works, but having a wife / husband/ girlfriend as your business partner will add more levels of stress to the whole entrepreneurship journey.",

After 500+ free consultations over 5 years, I realized something uncomfortable:\n\n90% never implemented anything. 5% implemented poorly then blamed my advice when it didn't work. 5% succeeded but never mentioned where they got the idea. The math: roughly 500 hours × €100/hour opportunity cost = €50,000 in free consulting.\n\nReturn on investment: 0 referrals, 0 clients, 0 equity, 0 thank-yous.\n\nSo I changed approach: \"Happy to help. My consulting rate is €150/hour. First 15 minutes free to see if I can actually add value.\"\n\nWhat happened surprised me: The time-wasters disappeared immediately. The serious people paid gladly and showed up prepared. The advice I gave was sharper because I had skin in the game. Implementation rate went from \\~10% to 80%+ because paying creates commitment.\n\nUncomfortable truth I learned: Free advice often helps your ego more than the recipient. When people have even €50 invested, they actually listen and execute instead of just collecting opinions. But suggesting this feels \"greedy\" so most of us keep bleeding time into conversations that go nowhere.\n\nFor those running service businesses: how do you handle the constant \"can I pick your brain\" requests without either burning out or feeling like an asshole?",

      "selftext": "I never thought that a decision made by Trump on the other side of the world could almost shut down my business. The story went like this. On August 19, we received an email from Omniva (Estonian Post): \"Starting tomorrow, we no longer ship parcels to the USA. Please find other delivery methods.\" August 20 is a public holiday in Estonia. The US accounts for about 60% of our wall decals shipments. We started looking for a solution urgently. We asked Omniva when it would be fixed. The answer: maybe 2-3 weeks, maybe 2-3 months. Meanwhile, sticker orders from America kept coming in.\n\nWe found a solution, though it wasn't pleasant. We decided not to turn off the US on marketplaces. On Amazon, Etsy, and eBay, everything depends on your rating. The more you sell, the higher you are in search results. Losing positions we built for years in one day would be a catastrophe. So, everything that used to go via Omniva, we started sending via FedEx. This is 3 times more expensive.\n\nA week later, the second blow came. All parcels generated before the 20th but handed over to Omniva afterward were returned. That was 70 packages. We finished September with a serious loss. Simply because delivery ate up everything. But we started to adapt.\n\nIt turned out that small stickers could be sent to the US in envelopes with a stamp they went through. This lowered costs slightly. In October, we managed to raise prices by about $5, fortunately, competitors did the same. The month ended with a small loss, but better than September.\n\nI want to clarify one thing: this was not the fault of the Estonian post (Omniva). Their systems were ready. The problem was on the US side, specifically with USPS, which was not technically ready to accept parcels, declare them, and process the data under the new regulations. It was a glitch in America, not Estonia.\n\nEvery week we were on calls with Omniva, waiting for news. And only in early November, after almost two months, Omniva finally reopened shipping to the US for business clients. We can exhale, but the price has gone up by about 1.5 times. Now, at least, it is clear what prices to set on marketplaces to work in the black again.\n\nMy conclusions:\n\nOn one hand, this political decision almost closed my business. On the other hand, thanks to this, we found new solutions, rebuilt our logic, and realized that as a team, we are ready for any surprises. A legitimate bonus: during this time, I made a great contact at UPS. They offered conditions better than FedEx in terms of both price and speed. We are already at the final stage of signing the contract.\n\nAlso, to minimize losses, we worked according to a \"silent\" algorithm: If an order came from the US, we packed it and put it on hold for 10 days. If Omniva didn't solve the issue in 10 days, we sent it via FedEx. If they did we sent it through them. Since the client has a standard delivery time of about two weeks, everything arrived on time.\n\nThat is the story.",

For this December even more, it will probably end up 80% down compared to last year.\n\nBut I did everything by the law. I complied, like a good little boy. Turned off USA while I signed with DHL deliver-duty-paid and when I did, I paid 300% more for every package to USA, tariffs included.\n\nYou wanna know what MOST other sellers in my local groups did? Nothing. They continued to send shipments illegally labeled as \"gifts\" via cheap national postage. They haven't paid taxes on the larger shipment bills, they did not pay tariffs, they did not pay increased platform fees since they did not have to increase their product price.\n\nAll of their packages were accepted, they wasted 0 time finding alternatives, they broke all the laws, paid none of the tariffs/fees and none of their packages were confiscated nor returned, everything was delivered and their November/December sales exploded.\n\nWhile the minority of us who complied with the suspension got our shops destroyed.\n\nSince learning this in December, i turned my USA shipping back on, but I get maybe 10% of my previous USA sales. I label them as \"gifts\" and ship cheaply via the national post. All of them got delivered without a single problem.",

The fact that you kept selling, absorbed the cost hit, and found workarounds instead of panicking and shutting down shows serious grit. Most businesses would have frozen or just stopped US sales entirely, killing their momentum and rankings.\n\nThe \"hold for 10 days\" strategy is brilliant. You turned uncertainty into a tactical buffer without breaking customer expectations. And pivoting to FedEx/UPS while keeping marketplace rankings intact? That's the kind of decision that separates businesses that survive shocks from ones that don't.\n\nWhat stands out most is your mindset shift. Instead of blaming the policy or waiting passively, you treated it like a forcing function to optimize. Now you're stronger, with better carrier relationships and clearer pricing. That's how you build resilience.\n\nThanks for sharing the full breakdown. Stories like this are way more valuable than the usual \"growth hack\" content.

We current use it with Sonnet 4.5 and it's been super impressive! It can basically make production changes to our web app from simple prompts, test changes, and improve automatically based on memory! \n* Perplexity: I think most people use ChatGPT and that is great. But for real time news and updates, Perplexity is great! You can basically setup a daily automation where it will pull relevant updates for you and auto send you a summary! \n* Sierra: Sierra is really good at auto resolving repetitive customer support tickets! It can learn from both past answers, your internal docs, faqs etc! We have gotten it to be able to resolve about 50% of all tickets instantly while rest are routed to real humans \n* Frizerly : Their AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website to help you improve your Google ranking is pretty impressive! It can auto identify content gaps from competitors, improve based on results etc! Much better tool than Semrush etc imo! \n* Gamma: After every client meeting. I get an AI Zoom Summary, it is then automated through Gamma. Gamma generates the final PPT for myself and client on what we discuss in summary and the next steps. Clients love that. \n\nExcited to learn from others!",

When I have such topics at scale, it's an absurd time-saver, to the point where I would procrastinate some work forever, if not for the AI.\n\n- one notable use in \"doesn't need perfection\" field is code generation for web dev. I can do a ton of work very quickly, prototypes, PoCs or even some features for production. Not everything and not always, reviewing plan and solution is critical, but it can be of a huge benefit (more like 1.5x here, but still).\n\nOh, and as a bonus: It can help me address some problems (e.g. issues with the damn printer), or be my [rubber duck](https://theconversation.com/stuck-on-a-problem-talking-to-a-rubber-duck-might-unlock-the-solution-261675).\n\nWhat I found, is that frequently for the people that complain about \"AI wasting time\" have a skill issue. **AI is like a nitro** - you use it as an additive to the fuel, rather than an all-out replacement, you need to know when and how much of it to use.",

These were real talks where prospects shared their pain points, concerns about working with us, objections, and what they actually cared about.\n\nWe then fed that dataset into an LLM and asked it to extract patterns: recurring fears, decision triggers, language customers use, and where our messaging was unclear or missing something. The output was basically a map of our biggest gaps and the exact areas where we needed to sharpen our positioning and value proposition.\n\nWhat’s wild is that this was like running deep interviews with 1,500+ customers. I honestly can’t imagine doing that before AI, or paying a marketing agency to do anything close at that depth and speed.\n\nResult: we tightened our value prop, clarified our positioning, and improved how we talk about what we do, based on the customers’ own words.",

He created infinite stuff from gadgets to fine art to papers, to business ideas. He had to learn all that by actually studying and experimenting. There were a lot of great fine artists, maybe even better than him at that time, but what made him an artist, is that he surpased them by knowing how to present himself, how to convince investors and the church and the government to give him land, how to manage resources, workers (who actually did all the work while he directed), and how to raise money. \n\nPeople just see the results and say, oh he's an artist cause he did this, without even analogizing the xyz factors that enabled him to do this. \n\nAn artist, or an entrepreneur is anyone who pushes the limits of what's possible in their domain. A banker can be an artist, a killer even can be an artist, no matter how unorthodox it sounds, or a tennis player, a developer, or an entrepreneur.

Some crabby lady said some rude things about it and insinuated that none of that mattered because it couldn’t be applied to what they were looking for.

Who knows what, it was probably something totally insaine I wanted to do. \n\nI spend 2 days off from school trying to figure out how to make money until I found a bulk deal on those little snap rocks that come in the white paper people used to get on the 4th of July. I could buy them for 25cents as long as I spent $60 on them 😂 \n\nSo to me this was a no brainer. Except I had to \"borrow\" my mom's credit card. So I wrote out a plan on a piece of paper to figure out how many I needed to sell to pay her back before the next credit card bill. Calculated with shipping.\n\nObviously I got caught, the whole thing was a disaster. Turns out you can only sell so many of them until the same kids get board and the state decides you're selling fireworks.\n\nI managed to make back $50 in a little less than 2 weeks if memory serves me correct. \n\nMy dad yelled at me because he thought I wanted to play with the snap rocks and the money was secondary. But then I started yelling at him because as much as I wanted to play with them, to me they were valuable merchandise and a means to an end (I can't for the life of me remember what I was trying to get enough money to do just trust me, it was probably something I my parents would have been right to say no to)\n\nBut his accusation made me emotional because it underlined the pain of sacrificing for something that didn't work out and how unfair it was that I don't even get recognition for my discipline. When I was in middle school half of all I wanted was recognition and the other half was freedom. \n\nSo I'm in my room crying like a baby and my dad eventually is kinda like dude, the state dropped the charges (I shit you not), you're not kicked out of school, I didn't even ground you... What are you so upset about? (God bless my parents 😂) \n\nAnd I told him, I wanted to sell the stuff to get an Xbox (which was a lie but... Close enough) and he started telling me about all these businesses he tried starting with his friends. And all the issues they ran into between getting molds for products or certifications to make specific claims or having enough money for different rounds of testing and then trying to convince an investor to give him more money when they blew through it. By the end of that conversation. I realized this is what I was going to be good at one day. I loved learning about things, breaking them down to steps, business plans. The fact it's kinda like gambling but not really. I was a bit of a lonely kid so just the emotional stimulation alone had me hooked. \n\nI think being an entrepreneur is less of a skillset, not so much a state of mind, it's an alignment of interests with a compatible perspective.",

Here's mine:\n\nIt took me until about 19 to call myself an entrepreneur (I didn't like the term before that for some reason), but then upon reflection I realized that I've been entrepreneuring my entire life instinctually.\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, all I wanted for Christmas/Chanukah (half-half family over here) was a cash register. Not sure if that's indicative of being an entrepreneur or because one half of my family celebrates Chanukah. That said, I ended up starting a \"video game business\" in my household where I took all my brother's xbox games, wrapped &amp; sorted them, then pretended to sell them to my parents.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old I was starting Minecraft servers and building out role structures, interviewing people to be moderators, setting up Discord channels, advertising the server on directories, working with players to improve their experience.\n\nAt 12, I started dog walking. About a year in, I hired all my friends to be dog walkers and turned it into a small business in our neighborhood where I got the new clients, earned a percentage of the walk, and managed the walking schedules.\n\nFrom 14-17, I worked at some companies doing customer service / other internships, and no matter what, I could not find myself being comfortable staying in one role for more than a couple months. I needed to create some kind of initiative at the company, move up, or learn something new.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I decided to start my own SEO consultancy and have since turned that into a creative + SEO agency (and I acquiesced to calling myself an entrepreneur).\n\nAll throughout those ages, I was creating new clubs at each school level (middle, high, college) and doing whatever I could to innovate what they offered. In high school, it was creating new arts organizations + initiatives; in college, it was creating the university's first true experiential arts event organization.\n\nNow I'm 22, graduated college with a degree in theatre/film and am running the agency - it would be impossible for me to live any other way.",

Much of the “market data” is behind paywalls because it’s designed for large companies, not for individuals trying to validate an idea. It often feels like others have a map while you’re guessing in the dark.\n\nMost founders deal with this by piecing together imperfect but real signals instead of seeking perfect data. Customer interviews, competitor pricing pages, reviews on sites like Reddit, G2, and Amazon, job listings, forums, and even sales calls can provide much more insight than polished reports. Scraping public information, running small paid tests, or talking directly to suppliers can offer surprisingly accurate insights at a low cost.\n\nIn practice, early businesses succeed not by having perfect data but by learning faster than their assumptions fail. The system favors larger players, but resourceful workflows, genuine conversations, and quick experiments often outperform expensive reports at this stage.",

Most market data is locked behind expensive reports or trapped inside the heads of people already in the industry.

DM them, buy them coffee, join niche communities where they hang out. First-hand insights beat any report.\n* Scrape competitor data: Check their pricing, reviews, website traffic (SimilarWeb, SEMrush free tiers), job postings (shows if they're growing/hiring for certain roles).\n* Use free/cheap tools: Google Trends, Statista (limited free access), government databases (census data, industry reports), Reddit/forums for qualitative signals.\n* Look at adjacent markets or analogous businesses. If exact data doesn't exist, find something close and extrapolate.\n* Pretend to be a customer. Sign up for competitor demos, ask sales reps questions, see what they pitch and how they price.\n\nThe dirty secret? Most founders are guessing with slightly better information than you. The difference is they test quickly, talk to users, and iterate based on real feedback instead of waiting for perfect data.\n\nYou're already ahead by asking this question.

That's FP&amp;A work. If they can't talk about 13-week cash flow models or explain what your runway looks like under different growth scenarios, they're not a CFO.\n\nRed flags:\n\n* They only talk about \"cleaning up your books\" (that's bookkeeping)\n* No process for regular forecasting or financial planning\n* Can't explain how they've helped similar-stage companies\n* Want a huge retainer upfront with vague deliverables\n\nWhere to actually find them:\n\n* LinkedIn, but search \"fractional CFO\" + your industry specifically\n* Ask other founders at your stage, warm intros beat cold outreach every time\n* Local accounting firms sometimes have CFO-level people doing advisory work\n* SCORE mentors can point you toward legit people in your market\n\nThe Upwork ghosting thing is real. Most good fractional CFOs aren't hunting for gigs on Upwork, they're getting referrals.\n\nWhat's \"starting to make actual money\" mean in numbers? Like $300K? $800K? $1.5M?

They see who actually delivers versus who just talks. Established fractional CFO firms also tend to be more reliable because they have process, oversight, and reputational risk. You pay more, but you’re buying reduced downside.\n\nOn pricing, $200 per hour isn’t a scam signal, it’s closer to market for someone who actually understands cash flow, forecasting, and decision support. The red flag is someone cheap who claims they can “do everything,” or someone who jumps straight into dashboards without first understanding how money actually moves through your business.\n\nBefore hiring, ask very specific questions: what metrics they focus on at your stage, how they’ve helped companies avoid cash crunches, and what decisions they’ve influenced, not just reports they’ve built. A short paid trial or project-based engagement is also reasonable before committing longer term.\n\nIf you’re early and mainly need cash clarity, sometimes a strong FP&amp;A consultant or experienced controller is a better first step than a full fractional CFO title. Titles matter less than whether they can help you make better decisions with the cash you already have.",

After a budget review last week where I had been given \\_zero\\_ guidance as to what I could spend, then receiving mundane questions 'have you tried using AI on that?' - I had a realization that I am better than these people who are getting &gt;$1M in total comp each per year. Call that arrogant, and I'm sure I'm lacking in other skills, but its been a consistent issue for me. \n\nQuestion is, what do I do about it? I'm wondering what other people did in my place? I can't seem to nail a good idea for a company, but I feel like that is the only way I can really feel empowered. I know that ultimately the customer/board will be my boss, but that's surely better than clueless executives? ",

A lot of founders look clueless because their job is not execution in a single lane. It is fundraising, people management, politics, tradeoffs, timing, and eating blame. From the outside it often looks like stupidity when it is actually context you do not see.\n\nThat said, if you genuinely cannot tolerate working under poor vision, the answer is not wait for a perfect idea. Almost nobody starts with one.\n\nWhat people in your position usually do successfully is this\nThey stop looking for a big company idea and start selling a narrow outcome they already know how to deliver. Consulting, contracting, freelancing, productized services. One problem, one customer type, one promise. That gives you autonomy without pretending you have figured everything out.\n\nYou also learn very fast whether your confidence is justified. Customers do not care how dumb your old bosses were. They only care if you can solve their problem and keep showing up.\n\nIf you cannot make money independently in a small way, founding a company will magnify the same frustration you already feel.\n\nStart small. Get paid directly by someone who chooses you. Let reality validate whether you should be in the founder seat or whether you just need more control over how you work.",

I’ve done all and consulting and digital products help\nBring in more than 6-figures a year. \n\n1. Affiliate marketing.\nYou don’t have to create a product at all. Just share tools or services you personally use or genuinely like. A lot of people on TikTok and YouTube are earning steady income this way, and once you understand how to place your links, it’s one of the lowest-effort income streams out there.\n\n2. Consulting.\nMost folks don’t realize how much their experience is actually worth. If you’ve spent years in any field : business, tech, creative work, ministry, fitness, whatever someone else is trying to learn what you already know. Offering simple consulting sessions can bring in quick income with very little setup.\n\n3. Digital courses.\nIf you can teach something step-by-step, you can create a small course. It doesn’t need to be complicated or long; it just needs to help someone solve a problem or get a result. Once it’s made, it can continue to generate revenue without you constantly working on it.\n\nAll three are beginner-friendly, affordable to start, and can be launched in a few weeks or less.",

Skills you might not see or value yet.\n* Starting a company means you'll deal with even more ambiguity and contradictions, except now it's all on you with no paycheck safety net.\n* \"I can't nail a good idea\" is a huge red flag. You don't need a world-changing idea, you need a real problem you're obsessed with solving.\n\nWhat to do:\n\n* Stay in your job but start building something small on the side. Test if you actually enjoy the entrepreneurial grind or just hate bad bosses.\n* If you're constantly frustrated, maybe the issue isn't the execs but the type of companies you're joining. Try a different stage or culture.\n* Work on finding a problem you care about deeply. Ideas come from obsession, not brainstorming sessions.\n\nEntrepreneurship won't fix frustration with authority, it'll just give you new, harder problems.

A dedicated business account (even just a separate checking account) plus something like Wave or a basic QBO subscription keeps things clean without overthinking it.\n\nIf you're dead set on combining, Quicken B&amp;P handles the basics okay. The tagging system works well enough for categorizing business vs personal.

Real ones.  \nThe kind where you spend months building, launching, and nothing happens, not even a single customer.\n\nOne thought kept coming back: **I didn’t fail because I was careless. I failed because I focused on the wrong certainty.**\n\nI’m a backend engineer with 10+ years of experience. So naturally, whenever I started something new, I focused on the technical part. Architecture. Clean systems. Edge cases.  \nIt felt productive, it felt safe, and that’s exactly why it became a problem.\n\nAcross those five attempts, the assumptions that hurt me the most were never technical. They were the ones I kept postponing because they were uncomfortable and unclear.\n\nThings like:\n\n* Will anyone actually care enough to pay for this?\n* Do people know this problem exists?\n* Am I building something people are already looking for?\n\nEach time, I told myself I’d test those later. After the product was “good enough”, after I felt confident, but later never really came.\n\nSo the hardest lesson for me wasn’t “build faster” or “market better”. It was this:\n\n**If you delay testing the riskiest assumptions, you’re not reducing risk. You’re just hiding from it.**\n\nWhat surprised me most is how easy it is to hide not from others, but from myself.  \nAs an experienced developer, the technical work felt safe and familiar. It gave me certainty, just not the kind a business needs.\n\nI’m still building. Just differently now. Curious: when something you built failed or succeeded, which assumption hurt the most when it turned out to be wrong demand, distribution, technical or something else?",

          "body": "Totally get this. Building solo is hard, and the lack of a built-in sounding board or emotional support makes it even lonelier. A lot of founders go through this single, and it's tough because entrepreneurship already isolates you, then add being solo in life too and it compounds.\n\nHere's what helps:\n\n* Find other founders to talk to regularly. Not just for advice, but for the emotional side. Accountability groups, founder dinners, even online communities where you can vent and celebrate wins with people who actually get it.\n* Don't wait for a partner to feel supported. Build your own support system: mentors, friends who check in, therapist if needed. These relationships can fill the gap in different ways.\n* Celebrate your own wins, even the tiny ones. Being self-reliant is a huge strength, and you're building something meaningful on your own terms.\n* The right partner will show up when you're already thriving, not to fix the loneliness but to add to what you've built.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way. A ton of solo founders wish they had someone in their corner, but they keep going anyway. You're doing something most people are too scared to even start. That takes serious courage. Keep pushing, the right support will come.",

Since the pandemic, getting work at design agencies has become harder for me because they want extremely high-level experts. I’m good at what I do, but I’m not the best, so I focus more on working with local businesses in my city and trying to slowly scale my business.\n\nThis season was both the best and the worst. I had a lot of work, so I hired another freelancer to help me. The problem was that she kept making excuses for late deliveries. For the video editing work I hired her for, she ended up doing almost nothing, and what she did deliver was poorly done.\n\nI tried to help her by creating SOPs and putting in a lot of effort to make things work, but it didn’t. In the end, I had to redo everything myself for a client who was already upset, and I ended up losing that client. Because of all that rework, I fell behind with other clients, which caused some of them to hold my payments.\n\nRight now, I don’t have money. I let the freelancer go, but I couldn’t cover her last invoice, and now she’s threatening to sue me.\n\nI’m really sad. I know I’m not a big company, but things got out of hand, and I feel cornered from all sides.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

She was hired to deliver, not just because she does hours. Being an intern is something else, then it is learning in the job.\n\nYes, you're getting sued; but you must ask for reasonable defense. You could sue her for losing customers. On the other hand you should have made the decision to terminate the contract and look for someone else. Maybe the best outcome here is both cutting your losses and part. Suing is very costly and both could end up worse.\n\nConsult a lawyer; maybe the first half an hour is free. So, go to a few and ask different questions before you settle on someone.\n\nSuing doesn't mean you have a right. It cannot always be exercised.",

I never started my own ISP but I spent over a decade working at small independent ones around the Midwest and really understanding computer networking, tech support and all kinds of Telecom, jargon and work. I was able to make a decent living with that and build a lot of skills and networks both technical and social. \n\nI lived at home till I was 25. Then I rented a place for 2 years. Then I bought my own duplex where I live in one unit and I rent the other one out. I had that paid off in about 5 years with a 15-year mortgage rents. Just went up enough and I knew I'd always want to have a roof over my head. \n\nI worked on my tech consulting business. I kind of had a really minimal one for years. You can say I technically started when I was in high school cuz I started making money then but it was really sporadic. Maybe work every month or every other super tighty. I just kind of kept it small and sporadic but it grew organically over time but I didn't put a lot of money into this. I just would have stuff get reinvested I would buy like a tool kit from money that I had business cards, a domain name, a basic one-page website and then over time I got a larger ecommerce website but really the ecom website and the LLC and a lot of the bigger stuff. Even getting business insurance was post covid and a lot of that happened in 2022 and 2023. It was a long slow bird and I ended up refining into senior citizen tech support both in person and remote as well as senior centers and teaching classes. There teaching classes at the community college that I went to. I teach continuing Ed classes there now on computers and technology. So I just kept growing and going but this was always a side hustle. I had ideas on what I wanted to do when I was younger and luckily they were built on a sound foundation and I was able to explore them grow and turn dreams into reality. Hopefully you'll be able to do that too. I still have a day job but my plan is to have a fully self-supporting self-employed tech Business and the rental income and then I should be set financially. Hopefully the above kind of answers your question. It was more just me reflecting on my experience but",

So you can use those lessons to your advantage. \n\nIf you haven't realized it by now, you've validated for yourself that following the Internet hype when it comes to which businesses to do or start simply doesn't work. That's not something you were going to learn any other way other than by trying those businesses and failing at them. Which you did.\n\nWhat you need at this point is find ways to experiment with more radical ideas but in a very low-cost way. You say that you're currently building software that can help your business and others...that's excellent! Get that one or two businesses that will use it and let them help you improve on it with their feedback. You need to achieve something that Eric Ries calls validated learning in his book, The Lean Startup. What that is simply is crucial info that helps you understand your customer needs better and improve the product or pivot the business.\n\nWith this approach, you won't just be trying out different businesses hoping something works out. Instead, you will be building something that eventually helps someone or a business and that way you can create a sustainable revenue source and overall an entrepreneurial journey worth journeying long-term.\n\nIf your time allows, I suggest you read that book by Eric Ries (The Lean Startup) and supplement it with The New Business Road Test by John Mullins. Same way heroes in films can inspire action so can reading about successful entrepreneurs who lay it all about their beginnings and how they built their business.",

I pushed myself so far that I ended up sitting in front of a psychologist, lost, burned out, depressed and stressed.\n\nEventually, I gave myself a break and got a normal job. Just for some time, I told myself, to breathe a little, maybe plan my next big idea, recharge and collect some energy.\n\nIt’s been two years since that decision and holy shit, am I happy.\n\nI deleted all that fake influencer social media crap and actually started living.

And that’s where it ends before it even begins.\n\nThe second hard truth, not everyone is meant to be a successful entrepreneur, and that’s completely okay. You can still make great money with a normal job, have free time and travel the world, especially now, with remote work becoming more and more common.\n\nSo my advice is simple, take a break. Breathe. Spend time with people you love. Find a hobby or two. Chill the fuck out.\n\nYou have time.\n\nAnd if later you decide you want to start a business, do it then. Plenty of people started at 50, 60 or even later.\n\nMost importantly, sit down and ask yourself why you even want to be an entrepreneur. You’ll get more answers than you can imagine, and a much clearer path forward.\n\nWishing you all the best and peaceful holidays, brother ❤️",

Look at your own progression: dropshipping, pressure washing, software that solves real problems. That's not random thrashing, that's figuring shit out.\n\nThe issue isn't that you can't get things right. It's that you're building things that solve problems people have, just not problems they'll pay to solve. That's actually the last filter before product-market fit.\n\nHere's what I'd do if I were you, this is from experience:\n\nStop trying to \"come up with ideas\" for a month. relax that mental muscle. Instead, just notice what pisses you off at your day job. What manual task do you constantly do that feels stupid? What problems keeps happening? What report takes 2 hours that should take 5 minutes?\n\nBuild tools for yourself first. Use them for a few weeks. If they actually save you time, show your coworkers. If they start asking for it, you might have something.\n\nThe best businesses come from scratching your own itch, not scanning the market for opportunities (again experience). You've already proven you can build and learn - you just need to solve a problem you personally feel every week.\n\n Taking a break to recharge isn't quitting. It's smart. You can give 100% to your day job and keep your eyes open for real problems without forcing yourself to grind on side projects out of obligation. Sometimes the best ideas show up when you stop looking so hard. \n\n The universe tends to push away the things we feel we desperatly desire. Relationships, money, opportunities and the more we stress over them the furthur away they get creating a cycle. You can get off the track at anytime. Take a breth and regroup. What worked, what have I learned?  Even if its what NOT to do.  Everything is a step forward ESPECIALLY failure.  There is not 1 person who tried something for the first time and succeeded.  Every successful personhad to deal with failure of somekind.  The difference between the successful and the \"failure\" is the failure fails to push on.\n\n I'm working on it and with AI, anything is possible at the moment. Rest, regroup and move forward my entrepreneurial brother",

          "body": "Late 20s is honestly very early to be drawing conclusions about calling it quits, even though it doesn’t feel like it when you’re tired and fed up. What you’re describing doesn’t sound like someone who’s failed repeatedly, it sounds like someone who’s been searching without a stable base underneath them yet.\n\nOne thing I’d gently challenge is the idea that every attempt has to be the thing. Most people who eventually make it didn’t bounce from idea to idea until one magically worked, they anchored themselves in something boring and reliable first. A job, a trade, a skill, an industry. Then they built from inside that, not from the outside looking in. Random businesses are hard because you’re fighting on every front at once.\n\nThe pressure washer example is a good one. It didn’t fail because pressure washing is a bad business, it failed because you had no leverage yet: no experience, no reputation, no repeat customers, no pricing confidence. That’s not a character flaw, that’s just physics. The same applies to software. Solving a problem people won’t pay for usually means the problem is real, but the buyer, urgency, or positioning is wrong, not that you’re incapable.\n\nAlso, exhaustion is a signal, not a verdict. When you’re burnt out, your brain tells you stories like “I’m running out of time” and “I’m wired wrong”. Neither of those are facts. They’re what happens when effort hasn’t compounded yet. Compounding always looks stupid and pointless right up until it suddenly doesn’t.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with going all-in on a day job for a while if it buys you energy, skills, and financial breathing room. That isn’t quitting entrepreneurship, it’s regrouping. Some of the most dangerous advice out there is never give up without acknowledging that timing, positioning, and season of life matter.\n\nIf you are wired differently, that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It usually means you’re better suited to building something slowly, from depth, not chasing opportunities from the surface. Find one domain, one skill, one problem space you can sit in long enough to actually understand. Let boredom work in your favour.\n\nYou don’t need a big idea right now. You need rest, stability, and one small win that proves to you that effort can turn into results. From there, ideas show up on their own.",

I’ve always been ambitious, disciplined, and productive, did a lot more than expected for my age and genuinely enjoyed working.\n\nLast year I opened my own office space, but it didn’t work out and I had to shut it down. I’ve accepted that maybe the timing wasn’t right, but ever since then I’ve been stuck.\n\nI have clients and ongoing work, yet I keep delaying everything. I procrastinate constantly, wake up late, smoke up, and can’t focus at all. What scares me is that my bank balance isn’t growing, but instead of panicking and working harder like I used to, I feel oddly numb.\n\nI know I’m operating way below my potential, and that makes me really sad. I feel lazy and just disconnected from my drive. Getting out of bed seems like a task. 15mins work is taking me 3-4 days of procrastination or even more sometimes. So many clients i worked with haven’t paid me for the work because it took me 3 months to send an invoice. I look at girls on instagram and think why isn’t my life as easy as theirs? why do i need to grind so much, i’m tired of being a boss lady. I used to feel incredible when younger girls looked up to me, but now i don’t know. I feel shit. I think marrying a decent guy is an easier option for the time. Sick mentality innit? But thats where the burnout has led me. \n\nHas anyone experienced this after setback or a business failure?\nWhat actually helped you get back into momentum?",

          "body": "Yes. This is very common after a setback. You’re not broken and you’re not lazy.\n\nWhat you’re describing sounds like burnout mixed with grief. Not grief for a person, but for a version of yourself and a future you thought you were building. When the office didn’t work out, something inside you took a hit, even if your brain says “it’s fine, timing was wrong.” Your body didn’t move on at the same speed.\n\nA lot of high performers don’t realize this, but drive doesn’t disappear because you’re weak. It disappears because your nervous system is tired of being in fight mode. So instead of panic, you feel numb. Instead of motivation, you avoid. That’s not a character flaw. That’s your system hitting the brakes.\n\nThe Instagram comparison is also a big clue. When you’re tired and disappointed, your brain starts looking for exits. “Maybe life should be easier. Maybe I don’t want this anymore.” That doesn’t mean you actually want to quit. It means you’re exhausted from carrying the identity of “boss lady” without rest or reward.\n\nA few practical things that actually help people get momentum back.\n\nFirst, stop trying to become your old self again. That person was running on adrenaline and excitement. You don’t rebuild momentum by forcing that. You rebuild it by shrinking the game.\n\nRight now, your only real job is to stabilize. Not grow. Not grind. Stabilize.\n\nSend invoices. That’s it. Not perfect invoices. Not all of them. One or two a day. Money coming in reduces numbness faster than motivation does.\n\nSecond, lower the bar so much it feels almost stupid. Fifteen minutes of work is too big right now. Do five. Set a timer. When it ends, you’re allowed to stop. Momentum comes from finishing, not from effort.\n\nThird, separate “I don’t want to work” from “I don’t want this life.” Burnout lies to you and tells you they’re the same thing. They’re not. You can be tired of how you’re working without being wrong for wanting independence or ambition.\n\nFourth, the smoking and late waking aren’t the cause. They’re coping. If you shame yourself for them, you’ll stay stuck longer. Fixing structure comes after energy comes back, not before.\n\nAnd lastly, about the marriage thought. That’s not a sick mentality. It’s a tired one. When people are overwhelmed, they fantasize about safety. That doesn’t mean you should act on it. It just means you need rest and support, not another identity to perform.\n\nMany people who’ve built things hit this exact wall in their mid 20s. Especially women carrying both ambition and expectations. The ones who recover don’t “push through.” They slow down, clean up basics, and let confidence rebuild quietly.\n\nYou don’t need to become a different person. You need to heal the part of you that feels like it failed.",

If you focus on doing these you'll almost certainly stop the procrastination and panic mode because you'll be focused on creating and it'll be your pride and pleasure. Of course this is just a judgement with the very limited info we have here, it could also be something completely different.\n\nAgain, its best to speak to someone who has actually dealt with this stuff before, i don't mind listening to you more and giving you a better judgement, either ways please take care of yourself first, i know its not easy, but this too will pass, don't worry :)",

But then the guilt from not doing it made everything worse.\n\nThe turning point for me was when I realized I didn't have to do everything myself, especially not the boring stuff that was contributing to my burnout. I got an AI assistant that could handle the invoicing, follow-ups, scheduling - basically all the tasks I was avoiding.\n\nSuddenly I wasn't drowning in admin work anymore, and I could focus on the parts of my business that actually excited me again. The creative stuff, the client work, the strategy - not the endless paperwork.\n\nIt sounds like you're dealing with the same thing where simple tasks feel massive. Have you considered automating some of the admin work that's piling up? Sometimes just clearing that backlog can give you space to rediscover why you loved your business in the first place.\n\nThe drive comes back, but sometimes you need to remove the obstacles first. Hang in there - this feeling isn't permanent.",

          "body": "It sounds like your brain, body, and system are “flooded.” So it’s no surprise that everything feels like procrastination or a no right now.\n\nYou’re definitely not alone. This happens frequently for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Add being an ambitious person, the impatience that usually comes with being in your 20s, and the comparison trap of social media, and it’s a recipe for judging, berating yourself and feeling like you can’t figure it out. The down side of social media is that it’s based on selective sharing, so we don’t see the full spectrum of life experiences and challenges in people’s lives.\n\nAcalem gave some really good advice in his post with regard to breaking tasks and timing down to even smaller chunks. \n\nI think one of the other pieces that I’m sensing is that enough people don’t talk openly about how hard it is to build a business regardless of one’s success level. It takes a lot of work especially if you’re doing it alone or don’t have a community of people who can really empathize with you and get it. Everyday you’re waking up to bring some meaningful contribution to clients, to your community, or to the world, and that requires A LOT from a human being mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, financially, relationally. \n\nBecause it takes your energy, it also requires lots of rest, recovery, resetting, etc. As a former collegiate athlete, I tell my clients all that time that as a leader or business owner, you have to think about yourself as an elite / Olympic athlete. These athletes are not practicing at 100% everyday. They have higher capacity days and lower capacity days. They also have rest and recovery days built into their programs. They’ve created success structures for themselves so that they can perform optimally and sustainably.\n\nSo as a business owner yourself, aka an elite athlete, I’d encourage you to practice extending some space and grace for yourself so that you can recognize that, maybe at the particular moment in time, you need some time for rest and recovery.\n\nWith regard to picking yourself back up after the setback, take some time to write down what didn’t work and why (if you haven’t already). \n\nWere you trying to do it all yourself? Did you not have the infrastructure in place? Was the space not right for you / too expensive? If you had a team, would it have made a difference? \n\nAs for the grief / burnout recovery, there are lots of good resources for this. Have you done any kind of exploratory / “excavation” work around naming and being with any hard / harsh feelings connected to disappointment? Do you have friends, a therapist, and/or a coach that you could work with to help you move through that type of work?\n\nLast thing, do you ever give yourself time / space / permission to just do nothing so that your mind can unwind and settle? The image of a snow globe comes to mind. When we are full or flooded, it’s like the snow globe that we shake up and watch all the snow flurries settle back down. If we don’t make space for doing nothing, then our brains, bodies, and systems can’t settle and we stay in hyper alert / overdrive. \n\nI hope this helps, and gives you some additional things to think about.",

Improving the product or service. Getting traffic. Following up with people who already showed interest. That’s it. Everything else is support work.\n\nI also cap my focus. One main goal per quarter. One main task per day. If I try to do five “important” things in a day, nothing really moves. If I do one boring but high impact thing, progress shows up.\n\nAnother rule that helps. Urgent does not mean important. Emails, DMs, tiny tweaks, tools, planning, learning more. They feel urgent because they are easy. Real growth usually feels uncomfortable and slow.\n\nIf something keeps coming up but never clearly helps growth, I ignore it without guilt.

If you can't protect it, then find a way to improve the product or your marketing/positioning. theyre a huge conglomerate and presumably late to the space and have to update any manufacturing/marketing/legal/ other large corporate shenanigans. use that time to get ahead and build your moat/customers. flood the market (assuming its a profitable product/market) and get those sales before they do. if they are a billion dollar company itll be like moving those big shipping container ships, its gonna take some time. use that to your advantage. who knows if you flood the market and the product is great they may even buy you out even if they have their own product in the pipeline. if the buyer is a product guy, he still has to convince his management, and the chain of command, etc. Meeting after meeting after meeting, just to agree then finally source, design, test, manufacture, etc.",

It doesn't have to be perfect at launch. You can swap it later if you need to do so.

If you are paying that much attention and money to your logo, you aren't spending that time and money on sales and distribution. Seriously, you think out of all the things a business should be spending time on, it's building a relationship with the person that will design your logo? That's a person that doesn't understand business. Or a company with an extremely large budget, and is looking for something specific.\n\nSure, there are iconic brands who's logos have become engrained in our society. But 99.9999% of all other companies logos don't matter at all. Or at least, AI can do just fine. As in, your human created logo is not going to increase your reveue any more than an AI generated logo. Or more accurately, the one logo you liked best out of the many many many logos you can have it make you to choose from. Or the AI logo you then tweaked a little. The effect on revenue is literally all that matters. It being made by a human does not effect that.\n\nHere is your genuine question.  \nShow me an unbiased study comparing AI to human logo and how they performed differently all things otherwise created equally. I'm not talking just what one group of people liked more. But some sort of concrete way the human created logo was the direct reason a company made more revenue where the AI logo made less revanue.",

Your company name/logo really doesn’t have much of an impact on your success, so there really isn’t a good reason to invest a bunch of money and time into the aesthetic of your company, unless it’s absolutely necessary.\n\nHowever, once you start making money, the business proves itself, then having an actual professional design your logo is a good investment, and really doesn’t cost much in the grand scheme of things. AI logos DO look bad, and lazy, and people can tell. So you’re right in that regard.\n\nI think AI definitely has a place in proof of concepts, and probably proves incredibly useful for clients to communicate design ideas to professionals.

I do embroidery and I can spot an ai-generated logo in a second, and they’re terrible. They have this uncanny valley sort of “somethings just slightly off” look most of the time, and it’s usually because of the text because it’s not made with a coherent font, instead it’s usually that each letter is generated individually and there’s minute differences between repeats of the same letter. \n\nI don’t mind so much when people are using it for a random logo for something that isn’t meant to generate profit. But when it’s for a business, it looks incredibly unprofessional to me. Even more frustrating is how many business owners make up a logo and then don’t save a high quality version of it. I often get sent off-kilter pictures of a printout, or a blurry low res version, or anything but the original file. \n\nI hired a designer (semi-local to me) to make my logo, and they nailed it. It cost me a whole $150. Good investment as far as I’m concerned. I know expenses are tight when you’re starting out but considering the impact a good logo makes, that’s a pretty small investment. And not everyone even really needs a full blown logo either. Your business name in a nice looking font is enough for a lot of businesses out there. It doesn’t make you less official.",

The pricing, policies, and consent forms were clearly disclosed and signed. During the appointment, I checked in multiple times, and the client specifically requested a very minimal result. I initially did more and removed strokes at her request. She also has a complimentary touch-up included if she wants additional fullness.\n\nPayment was made using her mother’s credit card (the service was a gift).\n\nAfter the appointment, the client herself did not contact me. Instead, her mother texted me angrily saying the price was “ridiculous,” called my business a scam, and said she was filing a chargeback. I submitted a full evidence packet (signed consent forms, before/after photos, appointment details, policies, etc.), and it appears the bank ruled in my favor.\n\nNow, after the bank decision, the mother has escalated. She has contacted me again - from a different phone number - demanding a refund within 48 hours and threatening:\n\n- Posting negative reviews and “blasting” my business on Google, Facebook, and Instagram\n- Reporting me to the BBB\n- Reporting me to state licensing boards\n- Using “connections” in the industry to harm my business\n\nShe has framed all of this as contingent on me issuing a refund.\n\nI have not heard from the actual client at all, and I have remained professional and brief, redirecting communication to the client herself.\n\nAt this point, this feels less like a service dispute and more like harassment or extortion. I have saved all messages and have not refunded.\n\nMy questions:\n1. Should I reach out to the client via phone call to understand the situation?\n2. Should I reply to the mother?\n3. What should my next steps be?\n4. Has anyone dealt with something similar after winning a chargeback?\n\nI’m trying to handle this correctly and not make things worse. Any advice from business owners or legal-minded folks would be appreciated.\nThank you.",

Start processing today. No real checks.\n\n2. Shortly after, they say funds must be held “for security reasons” while you continue operating normally.\n\n3. You are encouraged to keep selling. Your balance grows. Stripe is happy to let it pile up.\n\n4. The moment funds are due for release, surprise. They suddenly need “additional documentation.”\n\n5. You submit everything requested. IDs, business records, invoices, proof of delivery, everything.\n\n6. After that, Stripe decides they “can no longer service your account” due to vague fraud concerns.\n\n7. They freeze the entire balance indefinitely “in case of chargebacks” and keep the money.\n\n8. Stripe claims they will refund customers. In reality, refunds often never happen.\n\n9. To protect your reputation, you are forced to tell customers to file chargebacks themselves.\n\n10. Stripe then points to those chargebacks as proof that they were right all along.\n\nFull circle. Self-fulfilling justification.\n\nThe reality is this. The account was fine. The transactions were real. The only thing Stripe did consistently was hold customer money while earning interest and shifting all risk onto the merchant.\n\nIf Stripe truly believed the activity was fraudulent, refunds would be issued immediately. Instead, funds sit. Customers wait. Businesses get destroyed.\n\nMore and more investigators are starting to recognize this pattern for what it is. This isn’t “risk management.” It’s systematic fund retention disguised as compliance.\n\nThis will come back around. And when it does, Stripe won’t be able to hide behind boilerplate emails and trust-and-safety buzzwords anymore.\n\nIf you’ve experienced this, speak up. Silence is exactly what lets this continue.",

          "body": "This pattern is real, but I think it’s less a secret “fraud playbook” and more a structural failure that hits small operators disproportionately.\n\nStripe isn’t actually deciding whether you’re honest or not. Their risk systems are deciding whether your business is *legible under stress*. When something trips a flag, the question isn’t “were these transactions real?” It’s “can this merchant produce a clean, auditable narrative fast enough that our internal confidence threshold clears?” Most can’t — not because they’re doing anything wrong, but because their ops live across inboxes, spreadsheets, Stripe metadata, and half-documented workflows.\n\nAt that point, the default outcome is account offboarding. Holding funds isn’t malicious so much as the path of least internal risk. It looks predatory from the outside because the merchant has zero leverage and no way to reduce uncertainty once the decision process starts.\n\nThis also isn’t unique to Stripe. PayPal, Square, Shopify Payments all behave similarly once volume or velocity crosses a line. The common failure mode is the same: founders are running real businesses, but their operational proof is fragmented.\n\nThis is one of the reasons we’re building Quorum (still in beta): not as a payments alternative and definitely not a magic fix for Stripe, but as infrastructure so businesses aren’t scrambling when a platform suddenly asks them to “prove legitimacy.” Centralized customers, jobs, invoices, inventory, fulfillment — basically making your operation readable instead of reconstructing it under pressure.\n\nIt doesn’t solve the power imbalance, but it can shrink the blast radius.  \nFor anyone curious: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

      "selftext": "Hello, the title hopefully clearly describes my situation. I purchased a business 5 months ago and have been discovering that there are customer accounts that show a total of nearly $150k in credit. \n\nCustomers paid a deposit toward the purchase of items that needed to be ordered prior to my ownership of the business, and I have been completing the sale of these items since then using the \"credit\" that they have on their accounts. There was no bank account included in the sale of this business, so there is essentially no money supporting the sales that are made with credit.\n\nIf this isn't making sense, I'll add some numbers and dates. \nLet's say that a customer wanted to purchase an item with MSRP of $10k on August 1st. The item wasn't in stock and had to be ordered, so the customer paid a $5k deposit on August 1st, the credit is added to their customer account and the item was ordered. I purchased the business on September 1st, previous owner said there was no business bank account (which seemed likely enough). On September 15th, the item arrives, customer is notified and comes in pays the remaining $5k of the $10k and takes the item. So essentially I only actually get $5k from this sale. The kicker is that I get a bill for the item on October 1 for $6k (the cost of the item), so now I actually lost $1k from the sale. This scenario happens dozens of times in slightly different variations.\n\nThe point of sale software shows $0 on August 1st and $10k on September 15th (even though the money actually hit the bank on the 1st) so I assumed it was all good on the 15th.\n\nMany items were ordered and sold, and it has taken me a long time to understand what has occurred. \n\nWhat do I do now? How do I recover the money?\n\nOne more thing, I'm paying for the purchase.of the business over time, the seller essentially financed that sale, so I figure I should be able to subtract the $150k from what I still.owe on the purchase... Right?\n\nEDIT: **The other part of this is that I worked for the business as an employee before I purchased it from the owner, so I saw that we were successful and knew that it was making good money, though I had no way of seeing the true financials in my role.",

Also tell him that you've discovered through research that usually businesses are sold with a working capital adjustment, which is a post-closing true-up to adjust the purchase price.  An average working capital target (current assets minus current liabilities) should have been negotiated as part of the purchase price.\n\nWhen buying a business, buyers write two checks: the purchase price (or down payment) and a working capital deposit into the new business bank account.\n\nFor example, had you set a working capital target before closing and a customer comes in between the target set date and the closing, and paid a $10,000 deposit, and the target is $0, the price should be adjusted by $10,000 in your favor, since the seller takes home the $10,000 and you have to fund it.\n\nI know this is a lot but try this and comment back if you need help.

The business owed customers either product or a refund. When you bought the business without the cash that came with those deposits, you inherited the obligation but not the money that funded it.\n\nSo in your example:\n\nCustomer pays $5k deposit before you own the business\n\nThat $5k should have been sitting in cash, offset by a customer credit liability\n\nYou didn’t receive that cash at purchase\n\nWhen you complete the sale, you collect the remaining $5k, but you still pay the full $6k vendor bill\n\n\nThat’s why it feels like you “lost” money on each sale. Economically, the loss already existed at purchase — it just shows up over time as you fulfill those orders.\n\nA few important points:\n\n1. You generally can’t recover this from customers. They already paid what they owed.\n\n\n2. This is something to raise with the seller, because those customer credits should have been addressed in the purchase price or paid out at closing. It’s very common for this to be handled as a purchase price adjustment.\n\n\n3. No, you shouldn’t unilaterally subtract $150k from what you owe without talking to a lawyer or CPA, but yes — conceptually, this is exactly the kind of issue that gets netted against seller financing if the contract allows it.\n\n\n4. Going forward, you should track customer deposits explicitly as a liability so this stops being invisible.\n\n\n\nYou didn’t suddenly discover that the business “wasn’t profitable.” You discovered that part of the balance sheet didn’t come with the sale. That’s a painful realization, but it’s also a solvable one once it’s clearly identified.",

You do look to be next to an apartment complex, which is good. Can you add a soda fountain, look into starting a coffee part of the business, or something else? Is there another niche that fits in with candy that you can add? \n\nAlso, you might want to consult an interior designer. When I’m buying from a locally owned store, I like it cozy and like to have lots of stuff to look at. This gives convenience store vibes and doesn’t really encourage browsing so much as driving in to buy one thing you want that you can’t get elsewhere. \n\nYour concept may need some tweaking if you want this to be sustainable. \n\nLastly, free samples are a great way to boost sales. If someone tries something they find out they like and then they buy it for many years to come, that’s bank for you. Can you open a new candy every day, cut it into bite-size pieces, and (don’t forget to list allergens) give those out? Make it a thing on social media with a calendar so that people know what day you’re opening what bars so if they want to try something specific, it draws them in.",

If it’s not your first holiday season, then I’d compare to last year. Who are your normal customers? Walk by people or people who seek you out and why? How are you communicating with your customer base? Email list / instagram /etc? I dont think to go to a candy specific shop for holiday shopping … wonder if for next year you can pair up with gift stores that would attract more customers over holiday season? Put your items near their registers or host holiday pop ups in your space for makers to bring more of their customers to you? Do you have holiday specific candy? Etc.",

We are in a saturated wedding market.\n\nDespite increasing our marketing, we are getting slightly (40-70) less leads. Our SEO rankings are good though. We are having less tours convert to tours and the leads that do come in, only a handful are ideal clients. So we close those.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we have construction next store but we’ve still been able to sell regardless in months with the construction.\n\nI am worried I’m going to run out of money in the business.

I used to be much less stressed and worked in tech sales.\n\nSo you did not work in the business before, it was just handed over to you, and now you’re miserable and losing money trying to manage it.\n\nBut just because you inherited a business, doesn’t mean you were meant to be a business owner. It’s a hard and stressful and lonely job and that life isn’t meant for everyone. And that’s okay!\n\nSo to me your options are: \n\n* Sell it. Sell the business to someone who *is* crazy about weddings and desperately wants to own a venue and will have a vision for it, get a job that doesn’t make you miserable and give yourself some peace of mind back. It is fine!\n* Focus on becoming a true business owner. Get an education. Be passionate about weddings and/or events and stay on top of trends. Quit all side projects and focus all your time and energy on your business. Educate yourself on the basics. Read! \n\nHonestly, and I say this in kindness, it doesn’t sound like number two is what you really want to do, so just know it’s fine to choose option one.",

First I would ask your vendor connections for insight on your venue.  If you dont have vendor friends (luxury planners and photographers)  that's your problem ! The wedding industry is built on customer service relationships. Reach out to the ones you liked working with the most in the last 2 years. They are the ones referring your clients !\n\nSometimes brides will book planners and photographers before they book their venue ! So make sure your venue is on their most - requested list.\nIf you dont have that start here....\n\n-Does your space need updates?  (Lighting, ease of use, parking , electrical , LANDSCAPING - genz brides want lots of places to take pictures. Make sure no area looks old and shitty ..historic is great, outdated and crumbling is not.) \n\n-Is your bridal suite amazing (open space with natural lighting and cozy furniture)  - this is where the future brides can imagine themselves getting ready with their closest friends - this is a big selling point. Consult with beauty vendors in your area!\n\n- is your venue difficult to work with ? (No good rain plan area, limited time to access, bad parking for guests, awkward layout for the wedding  ) \n\n- does it come with good catering?  Do brides have to pay for every small thing or do you include a lot?\n\nIs your venue able to accommodate other groups such as showers, parties , dinners ? Many venues in my area offer \nBrunches and special dinners (holidays ) to bring in off season money.\n\n\nYour seo and marketing might be good in paper but are you looking at your venue as a bride ? Would you drop 30k on your venue ? Maybe go tour your competition and see what they offer. \n\nWedding venues should make absolutely bank. The most successful in my area do 3 weddings per weekend in our busy season - fri/sat /sun,  have amazing catering and charge $30k-45k base . Depending on your area you might get 6 months of busy season and if you have a nice indoor options you could operate in the \"off season \" 12 months a year.",

This is my first comment on something in small business sub. \n\nYour situation is likely a marketing and customer relations issue.\n\nSaying the market has changed or slowed or what ever is a cop-out. Market conditions are always changing and it’s the owner/operators job to predict and plan for every scenario. As an entrepreneur you’re always going to have times where you’re flying a little to close to the sun. \n\nSo in this situation I would ask - who is your target customer and how do you get in front of them? \n\nWell the question is nuanced because who is the real decision maker? The groom? The bride? The planner? The mother of bride? The person who’s paying for it? … every situation is different. \n\nBut there is one thing that is constant… the planner. If you want consistency in your business you need to build airtight relationships with all the planners in the area so that when they do a venue presentation you’re always on the list. \n\nBut how do you do that? Well here is the “fun” part. You have to work the phones and door knock. Small gifts work too once you have a budding relationship. Pick the top 100 planners and make it your mission to get in contact with all of them over the next 30 days. Sometimes it means showing up to their office or phone calls or mailers. And make sure to build a deep personal relationship when you have a planner on-site. Also - All this has to be you - very important - can’t hire this out. \n\nLast thing is the planners are going to ask “what’s in it for me”. As you know most planners take a percentage of vendor sales which is often disclosed in the contract with the client. Figure out appropriate incentives for the planners based on the industry standard.\n\nThis is the hard target market that nobody wants to work. Much harder than buying an ad or writing an SEO page. Well in business that’s where the money is  - the boring hard stuff",

Our BCBS rates are going up to 2400 a month with no pre-existing conditions.  The subsidies have expired.  We didn't renew by the Dec 15 in hopes something would get done in Congress because we can still enroll by Jan 15th.  I just do not understand how Health insurance with huge deductibles can actually cost 2400 for 2 people.  My mother who is 76 and lives with me because she has late stage Alzheimers pays 280 a month with Aetna because she was civil service and Federal government subsidizes her healthcare.  She doesnt get Medicare because she didnt pay enough into it but at 280 a month, she is good.  This entire system is a joke.  I feel like I am being punished or farmed.\n\nMy question is what are some other options?  Maybe just catastrophic insurance and then Primary care use cash.  We are trying to save to retire but with Homeowners insurance going up every year as well as Auto insurance and now this.  Its simply unsustainable.\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to add a very weird fact to this all.  One of the many reason i have no trust in insurance companies.  A few years ago Humana pulled out of our county and we had to change insurance providers.  We ask why but in short the reason was they lost money or the zone we live wasnt profitable, blah blah.  The irony when I saw them place 400 piece order with our gift shop later that month.  They obviously are not hurting on money",

But here is some info:\n\nInsurance companies calculate your premiums according to the following things:\n\n* Your age\n* sex\n* zip code \n* smoker or non smoker\n\nThey use these benchmarks to calculate the risk they are taking by bringing you on board. Your medical conditions don't matter anymore because of you are on an ACA plan. The older you are, the higher the cost. Men are more expensive than women because they have more medical issues the older they get. The insurance companies in the United States exist to make money, so they price everything accordingly. \n\nThe price they come up with for insurance coverage whether you have an ACA plan from the marketplace, a plan from your employer, or even Medicaid and Medicare is the same. The price is the price. \n\nWhat you pay then depends on how much your employer covers, how much the government pays (ACA subsidies or medicaid or medicare). Insurance companies are raising their prices because the cost of healthcare continues to skyrocket and Republicans have decided that they don't want the government to pay for the ACA subsidies anymore, so individuals like your have to pay full price now, which is statistically higher than ever before.\n\nI used to work in insurance and honestly, the catastrophic plans are a scam and really difficult to navigate for someone who is not versed in their exclusions. You could get a private non ACA plan that will look at your medical history to get you approved, that is more affordable than your current plan, but it is not as comprehensive. There's a lot more to explain on how that works, but hopefully you get the gist. \n\nMy recommendation is to just eat the cost and stay fully insured. Being in your 50s with a business and a spouse to worry about, it;s not worth the risk .",

You're paying for clicks on a specific offer, then confusing people when they land.\n\nIf you're advertising coaching, the landing page should only show coaching. If you're advertising meal prep, only show meal prep.\n\nIt should be this simple:\n\n* What is your offer?\n* Does the page you're sending them to deliver ONLY that thing?\n\nIf not, make a simple landing page first.

CPLs will be much lower pretty much across the board as the CPM is much higher for destination conversions vs on platform ones. But also, rebutting this point, if you are in B2B tech, brand campaigns (despite their polarization with marketers), the goal absolutely should be to send traffic to the website. Post that touch point, if you have the right tech stack, you can then segment traffic based on traffic source and depending on the pages landed, segment your audience into TOFU/MOFU/BOFU.",

          "body": "From what I’m seeing, businesses that sit on top of real problems, not hype, will grow the fastest. A few stand out clearly.\n\nAI-enabled services for small and medium businesses will grow quickly. Not flashy AI startups burning cash, but practical automation. Things like customer support, bookings, quoting, finance admin, compliance, marketing, and internal tools. The winners will be the ones that package AI in a simple, trustworthy way and actually save time or money. The big challenge here is trust, data quality, and not overpromising. People are already tired of AI solves everything nonsense.\n\nHealthcare, wellbeing, and ageing-related services are going to explode. Populations are ageing, public healthcare systems are under pressure, and people are more willing to pay privately than ever before. This includes remote monitoring, home care, mental health support, preventative health, and assistive tech. The challenge is regulation, ethics, and delivering real outcomes rather than just apps and subscriptions that don’t move the needle.\n\nCybersecurity and digital trust businesses will grow steadily. As everything moves online and AI makes scams and attacks more convincing, security becomes a non-negotiable cost, not a nice to have. Small businesses are especially vulnerable and under-protected. Growth here will favour firms that simplify security and education, not those that rely on fear. \n\nNiche e-commerce and specialist brands will continue to outperform big generic retailers. People are happy to buy from smaller brands if they feel understood and looked after. This works best where there’s expertise, curation, or a strong story, not just cheaper prices. The challenge is margins, logistics, and not being crushed by ad costs. Community and repeat customers matter more than scale.\n\nEducation and reskilling businesses will grow, especially outside traditional institutions. People know that one career for life is gone. Short, practical learning that leads directly to better income or flexibility will win. This could be technical skills, business skills, or even trades done in smarter ways. The challenge is credibility. Too many courses overpromise and underdeliver, so trust and real-world results are everything.\n\nLocal services that use technology well will quietly do very well. Repair, installation, logistics, home services, and specialist maintenance aren’t going away. Businesses that layer tech, automation, and good customer experience on top of boring but necessary work will be hard to compete with.",

As a franchise expert, I’m constantly looking at these exact trends to see where the \"smart money\" is moving.\n\nIf we look at the next 5–10 years, I see three specific areas that aren't just growing, they're becoming essential:  \n  \nSenior Care &amp; \"Age-in-Place\" Services: With the aging population (Boomers), there is a massive surge in demand for in-home care, senior moving services, and home modifications. It’s a very resilient sector because it’s a necessity, not a luxury.  \nEco-Maintenance &amp; Green Energy: It's no longer just about solar panels. Businesses focusing on EV charging station installation, battery storage, and \"green\" home services (like eco-friendly insulation or HVAC) are going to explode as infrastructure catches up with climate goals.  \nHealth &amp; Personalized Wellness: We’re moving away from \"big box\" gyms toward boutique, specialized health concepts—things like IV hydration, longevity clinics, and tech-enabled mental health services. People are willing to pay a premium for health \"optimization\" rather than just basic fitness.\n\nThe biggest challenge? It’s definitely going to be **labor**. Finding and keeping quality people is the hurdle every business owner faces right now. That’s why systems and automation are so huge, the businesses that win will be the ones that use technology to make their human staff more efficient.\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be building. Are you looking at these trends from an investment standpoint, or are you thinking about starting something of your own?",

The first time we visited the owner introduced himself, showed up to our table, recommended dishes, and overall made for a very pleasant experience. The restaurant is a bistro with very nice e decorations and cool jazz music in the background that was low enough for guests to hear themselves while speaking.\n\nOur second visit was a much different experience. No owner, no recommendations, and semi-attentive waitresses (all college age) that gave cursory service; but the worst of all was rap music being played very loud to a level where it was hard to hear anything at all. \n\nMy opinion is that the waitresses/cook/ staff changed the music and arrangements to what they liked, notwithstanding what the customers would like. \n\nAs a small business, it should be paramount to present a pleasant atmosphere that draws in customers.

Your older employees absolutely notice when they show up on time every day and others don’t, and that resentment builds quietly.\n\nOne way you can handle it is to stop focusing on “late” and focus on what matters. Coverage starts at X. Handoffs need to be clean. If someone needs flexibility, they should talk to you instead of just drifting in late.\n\nI wouldn’t fight over five minutes unless it’s hurting the business.

But all of your employees are performing well and doing what needs to get done? I honestly can't fathom why the salary person is complaining unless this directly impacts them in some way. I'd recommend a flexible schedule with core hours. Like everyone needs to be in the office from 10A-2P, but otherwise make sure you're at every meeting, meeting your benchmarks, and working your 40 hours. Obviously this is industry dependent. Flexibility goes a long way for single people who are responsible for everything in their home to parents with drop offs and pick ups, and everything in between but in my experience flexibility helps retain the best talent the longest.",

There’s no silver bullet, and this conversation often raises more questions than answers.\n\nThe first thing to look at is the nature of the job. In roles where timing is critical, like childcare, customer facing coverage, or safety related positions, being on time is not optional. If coverage is impacted, then the expectation is clear: being late isn’t acceptable (PERIOD).\n\nOn the other hand, there are roles where output, collaboration, and results matter far more than watching the clock. In many tech and knowledge based jobs, no one is tracking minutes as long as the work gets done and you are not bottleneck.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is fairness and morale. When some employees consistently arrive late while others are dependable and punctual, it can quietly erode trust, even if the actual impact on operations is small. That’s usually the real issue, not the 1–8 minutes themselves.\n\nFor me, the balance is setting clear expectations based on the role, applying them consistently, and addressing patterns early in a respectful, private way, before small issues turn into resentment.",

If you do a logo, make it small and subtle. A little icon or something less obvious is a good way to brand something without taking away usability. Using a mug as an example, a basic ceramic one with a loud logo will be the first i declutter. A nice quality one with a subtle logo would be more appreciated. \n2. If you’re not doing your own decoration, don’t pay extra to get it done. You care more about the logo than anyone receiving it. \n3. If it’s low budget, don’t buy junk… just get a giftcard. We can design beautiful gift boxes but $20 doesn’t go far without looking cheap. With a $20 amazon gift card, i can put it towards that thing I wanted, A pair of socks looks cheap. If you really want to do swag, then give something small, knowing it may be trashed, but give something else with it, like a giftcard. \n4. Echoing 3, but don’t buy the cheap version of something. A $10 cooler is still a $10 cooler… probably not very good. \n5. Real examples of interesting swag I’ve seen (not just more expensive everything): leather goods like nice coasters, key fobs, and Dopp kits. Tech organizers. Hand thrown mug with small stamped logo. Custom keyboards. Olive wood cooking utensils. Hot pads/ oven mitts. Glass togo container. Wireless charger. Mixed reactions on journals.. small accessory to go with a themed gift- ex- coffee scoop with nice coffee, chopsticks with a ramen gift, popcorn bowl with movie theme, candle snuffer with spa theme. \n\nSmall tip for anyone ordering swag. ALWAYS order more than you need, especially when on a clock. Almost every company will send a few with misprints. Obviously returns depend on the vendor, but there’s always an error",

          "body": "If you’re going to put your logo on something make it a comfortable high quality hoodie and make the logo small. So it’s something they’re happy to wear runnings errands or at work or going out if it’s the only hoodie in their car and they’re cold. They don’t want to feel like a billboard for your business. \n\nMy bfs company gave out A LOT of swag so many different things as well as a fuck ton of gifts at his Xmas parties. I truly miss that job for him. I got a Dyson air wrap at his last party 😭\n\nI’d say sweaters is usually a safe bet. \nBut honestly, the cost you’d get those for, most employees would honestly rather have the $10 gift card to Starbucks or McDonalds or target. \n\nNo logo plates or coffee cups they’re going to cost you money and end up in the garbage that holiday weekend. \n\n\n\nThe most thoughtful thing you can do for people is usually kind of personal and unless your business is small enough to actually know things about them  then it will never be personal enough, and a small gift card or hoodie is probably the nicest thing you can do.",

For the past 6 years I have done all of his bookkeeping while he does all the hands on work. Every quarter, it’s always a battle to get all the receipts from him and organized and I absolutely dread it. I work part time already in my own job, but I pick up a lot of shifts too. His business has continued to grow and taxes are getting more and more complicated adding on the house flipping and rental income. I used to have just 1 excelsheet for his LLC and now I have like 4 for all of his different business ventures. It’s December again and I already know this will consume and ruin my month. He is just not good at bookkeeping and I know if he tried to do it himself he would miss major things. I feel resentful to him because I feel like this is falling on my shoulders and I’m done with it. When I try to tell him this, he says it is “our business” and I benefit from the money made in the business. I think it might be time to hire a bookkeeper for my sanity and for the sake of our marriage…. Thoughts anyone? Rant over lol. \n\nEdit: I also manage our Airbnb and do all the cleanings/turnovers myself. I don’t mind doing this, but it is just one more thing on my plate. ",

I wanted her to be and we figured out she could do the books and handle some calls.  It was a small contracting service business so maybe 5-10 hours a week.  I thought it was perfect and it kept her in the loop and a part of things.   Long story short, things weren’t getting done, slow to get done or not the way I wanted.   Now I had to walk the fine line of not talking to her like an employee.  As we grew, we ran into exactly what you described.   I slowly started doing more of the office work and she noticed. Then I questioned something one day and she said “‘maybe you should just take over everything again.”  I happily agreed.   It may have saved our marriage lol. It’s a hard line to balance on.

You don’t need permission, a boss, or a formal application to try. That lack of friction gets misinterpreted as lack of difficulty.\n\nWhat’s often left out is that simplicity at the start usually trades places with complexity later. The hours, risk, uncertainty, and emotional load don’t disappear, they’re just not front-loaded the way a 9–5 is.\n\nThere’s also survivorship bias and platform incentives at play. People who made it through tend to talk about the freedom and autonomy, while the stress, failed attempts, and long unprofitable stretches don’t perform well on social media.\n\nSo I don’t think most people mean “easy” as in low effort. They mean:\n\nno formal barrier to entry\n\nautonomy instead of structure\n\nupside without a salary cap\n\n\nWhether that’s preferable to a 9–5 really depends on someone’s risk tolerance, financial buffer, and what kind of stress they handle better. For many people, a traditional job is actually the harder-earned stability.\n\nYour instinct is right. Early-stage business ownership is usually harder than a 9–5, just in different ways.

That part *is* more straightforward than navigating corporate ladders, politics, performance reviews, and permission structures. But execution-wise, it’s usually harder than a 9–5 in almost every dimension you listed: hours, stress, risk, and ambiguity.\n\nThe people framing it as “easy” usually fall into one of three buckets:\n\n* **They’re selling something** (courses, coaching, vibes).\n* **They already crossed the hardest phase** and forgot what it felt like.\n* **They’re confusing autonomy with ease.** Owning your time feels lighter, even if you’re working more.\n\nWhat doesn’t get talked about enough is that early-stage business difficulty isn’t the *work* itself, it’s the cognitive load. You’re the CEO, ops manager, bookkeeper, sales, compliance, and customer support simultaneously. A 9–5 externalizes most of that complexity.\n\nIronically, this is also why so many small businesses struggle long-term. Not because the idea is bad, but because operations never get systematized, so the founder stays stuck carrying everything in their head.\n\nThat’s actually the problem we’re trying to address with Quorum (still in beta). Not making business “easy,” but making the operational side less chaotic once things start working—so founders can build systems instead of just enduring stress. It’s not for everyone, and it doesn’t remove risk, but it helps reduce the constant context-switching that burns people out.\n\nThe honest framing should be: starting a business isn’t easier than a 9–5. It’s just a different kind of hard, and some people prefer *that* kind of hard. For those who do, having real operational structure matters a lot more than the motivational slogans people post online.\n\nIf relevant: [https://usequorum.app](https://usequorum.app)",

I was over £14,000 in debt and this genuinely felt like my last shot at turning my life around. I didn’t quit my job or take some blind leap, I kept working a normal job while building the business on the side, I knew absolutely nothing at the start. While working, I listened to podcasts. When I got home, I applied what I’d learned. I made zero sales for the first 3-4 months. But I never viewed that as “failing” I viewed it as building something.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\t•\tFirst year revenue just over £220,000\n\t•\t£110,000 of that in the last 3 months\n\t•\tNo staff (just me and my wife)\n\t•\tI’ve quit my job\n\t•\tPaid off all my debt\n\t•\tBought a house\n\t•\tRetired my wife\n\t•\tBought a car\n\t•\tStarted a second online business 3 months ago that’s already done £25,000\n\t•\tPlanning a third business in January\n\nIs it easy? No.\nIs it anywhere near as hard as some of these comments make out? Also no.\n\nA lot of people talk about taxes, bookkeeping, ads, websites, logistics etc as if they’re insurmountable obstacles, they're not, they’re just skills you learn over time. Problems don’t disappear, but you solve them as they arise.\n\nToday I work 2-3 hours a day. Problems still happen, but I’d much rather fix occasional issues for this level of reward than work 10 hour days to earn in a week what I now make in half a day.\n\nIf I had read comments like many of these before starting, I probably wouldn’t have tried and that would have cost me everything I have today.\n\nStarting a business isn’t “easy”, but it’s also not this impossible, soul destroying nightmare people describe I have more freedom now in my life than I've ever had. Most people fail not because it’s too hard, but because they quit before the compounding effect kicks in.\n\nFor the person who asked the original question,\nDon’t let other people’s fear decide for you, take the very small risk whilst working a normal job and learn, you'll find out very quickly if it is or isn't for you.",

I do have enough savings to get by, but the overthinking still kicks in, especially at night. I am continuing to invest in advertising, and I have a strong online presence with good reviews and solid creatives, so the slowdown has been a bit discouraging and confusing.\n\nI am based in Texas, in the U.S., so I am especially curious if others in similar markets are seeing the same thing and how you usually handle slower periods.\n\nAppreciate any insight or shared experiences.

Talking to other vendors, it's that way for everyone from the farmers to the crafters and hot food vendors. My business is a dog bakery. I feel so bad when I see the dogs I know wanting to run over to me but the owners trying to quickly guide them away. Some of them have told me recently they have to watch their spending so they are rationing the treats. I told them to come by and let their dogs get my samples regardless of whether or not they can buy anything. The dogs don't understand keeping a budget. I know they'll buy again when they can. The way things have been going, I'm having to scale back the business to only the weekends and focus on regular work as a web developer and digital marketing - the bakery will just be a hobby business going forward.

Those are very different signals.   \n  \nA seasonal pause in new demand is common, especially toward year end, and it can feel scary even when the underlying setup hasn't changed.

It's one of the big advantages of owning your own business and if you're not doing it that's a ton of money on the table. Save the receipt, write on it what it was for, save it in your bookkeeping software to reference if you ever get audited. This applies to literally any reasonable expense that could be justified as marketing costs that would not have happened if you didn't own a business. Reasonable means reasonable - client gifts absolutely count, but not if the gift is like... a jet ski or if your client is actually your aunt. Buying things they ask you to buy is even more clear cut - I would even say you're in the right to charge your client for milage and hours doing this. I wouldn't charge clients but definitely should be writing off that milage involved at the IRS milage tax rate.\n\n\nFyi - you don't need to charge to a biz card to do this. All that matters is the receipt. A business card isn't anything special - it a normal credit card in every sense of the word except one that is marketed towards businesses. You can write off stuff on your personal card and you can charge personal items to a business card, the IRS or the banks don't care at all. It just makes your life easier knowing that your business card truly only has business transactions on it, which is especially important if you have employees.",

The bits about the LLC as mentioned below really don't play into your situation as you don't have anything to really be protected from, you driving to and from and your management decisions will not be absolved by the LLC if something occurs. Good insurance on the other hand is vital! Just make sure you add line items to your invoices of Items Purchased for Client (or something to that accord) and tag it out as a separate line item so your end of year taxes will be cleaner because you can tie the COGS to that specific Revenue, quick and clean. Document everything because you can add mileage and other expenses due to the nature of delivery and get a pretty nice chunk deducted for that as well, presuming you own the vehicle and not the company.",
