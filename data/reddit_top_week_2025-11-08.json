      "selftext": "Real talk, podcasting doesn’t get enough credit as a side hustle. Everyone’s chasing dropshipping or freelancing, but a simple niche podcast can actually stack up fast if you’re consistent.\n\nI started mine talking about random stuff I was already into, didn’t expect much, but it picked up once I started uploading to Spotify, YouTube, and a few other platforms. Between listener support, affiliate plugs, and platform monetization, it turned into a decent passive stream.\n\nIf you’ve got something to say (or even just a hobby you rant about with friends), record it. You don’t need crazy gear either (I even started recording using my crappy Blackshark gaming headphone)\n\nAnyway, I'm on my 3rd month of earning over $500 a month. Not enough to pay all the bills, but it does help w groceries and other random expenses",

      "selftext": "Background: I run a small international snack brand called Pop Snax, which I started 2 years ago. Initial operations were out of my apartment where snacks took up every inch of space, lol. I've grown steadily over the last year, and I'm now working out of a co-warehouse space.\n\nAnyway, last Sunday, something wild happened. A huge influencer (Joe Bartolozzi) who randomly ordered one of my mystery snack boxes in August, unboxed it on stream/Youtube. Had no idea who he was so I had no idea he was even placing an order. Within hours, my website traffic exploded. Shopify was dinging nonstop.. I got over 300 orders in two days. I was super confused at first and asked a customer how they found me, and that's when I found out about the influencer unboxing.\n\nI cried almost constantly for the first 2 days bc this was one of those surreal “this is actually happening” moments, and I had no idea what I'd done to deserve this. Since last Sunday, orders have been heavy and consistent and the video featuring my box has hit 850k views!\n\nWhile running the business, I also work a full-time job, so, I've been running on fumes trying to keep up with customer emails, packing, and fulfilling, often late into the night. It's been exciting, but also kind of chaotic.\n\nAnyway, this viral moment has given me my first real taste of HEAVY demand at scale, but its also exposed how under-resourced I am as a solopreneur. I don’t have a team yet, or fulfillment support, and I’m still figuring out how to maintain that momentum after the viral wave calms down.\n\nEven with the boost, I know growth won't be linear. There’s still the day-to-day grind I'm trying to figure out, i.e. running ads, improving packaging, managing costs, dealing with platform issues (looking at you, Amazon 😅), and trying to make every customer happy. I'm trying to get deep into AI, so I can offload some of that pressure/manual oversight.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything! And if anyone else here has gone viral with a product or business, how did you handle the surge? Did you manage to sustain it afterward?",

Find some students to come help with packing and shipping so you can focus on the more strategic work.  Get some lined up, explaining the work will be sporadic.  Only bring them in when the surge in orders will cover the staffing expense.  If you can afford it, pay some for a few hours of training so they are ready when you need manpower\nInstall cameras in your work areas so you can keep an eye on them… you’ll soon see which are worth keeping around. Identify not only those who are good at the packing, shipping etc, but also look for those who have an “ownership mindset” who think like business people and who bring their brain to the job, not just the muscle.\nWhen you find those exceptional “owners” invest in mentoring them, involve them in marketing g and inventory and anything else you can expose them too… they become your key employees\nTry to complement your skills.if you are a great marketer, look for bookkeeping instincts.  If you love sourcing new products and managing pipelines. Look for online marketing thinkers\nInvest as much profit as you can into staffing, if you staff right, that will drive growth faster than anything\nAnd, if you don’t have a detailed business plan, write one.  The better you are at identifying key milestones and inflection points, the faster you will build the business. every library has books on writing business plans… take this step seriously and it will pay off.\nFinally, as soon as time allows, get yourself an advisory board; potential\nMentors with experience in areas you don’t know well.  They can help you refine your planning, help you avoid the predictable mistakes most new business owners make, and make connections that will support your businesses growth.  I’m not talking about big name advisors, I mean a friend of your parent who is a CPA, a local shopowner who understands cash flow, a retired exec who can help with strategy and bank contacts, etc.\nGood luck!",

You won’t get paid a lot or fast but at least you can turn some of your gaming time into cash. \n\nWith some caution, check out facebook marketplace and Craigslist for jobs and free items you could resell near you. \n\nYou can also look into clinical trials, but always remember they could go bad. Had my asthma get worse doing one trial so I haven’t done one since. \n\nIf you aren’t continuing to rack up debt, then try debt consolidation to help lower what you owe back and make payments more manageable. Once you do that only keep one credit card and cancel the rest. Temptation is too strong. \n\nIf you can drive you might want to look into an old but decent car. Try brands that are easy to get replacement parts for and fix yourself. Be careful of dodge’s battery placement type things 😑. If not and biking isn’t an option, maybe see about carpooling with someone who lives near you. Offer to pay them so much a week to tag a long. My hubby takes 3 to work and they each give him $20/week so it pays the weekly gas costs. \n\nI hope it gets better for everyone and soon. You should be able to have a little fun at least if you work. Not just barely scraping by. Good luck and hang in there. 🤞😖",

I know you're using Uber now, but if you can team up with a friend who has a truck or suv, you could both make some money. I did that with a friend before my SUV broke down, when I was still living up north. Just an idea.\n\nHave you checked out r/beermoney? It's a bit more tedious and not always quick but it's worth checking out. Dscout is my favorite and that's where I've made the most money. Sometimes, you test apps/websites, sometimes you're just giving your opinion or experience with something. I forget if there was a wait list but I'd sign up if I were you, so when you're not working, you can apply for tasks on there or do the express missions.",

It's really easy to get certified--just follow their instructions. It helps if you already have some sample videos you can post, but you could also grab something from around your house and make a quick video. My experience has been that you have to do gifted collabs or $5 jobs to get your ratings up before anyone will hire you for anything else. And for my $5 jobs, I've had to purchase the products up front ($48 and $40) and then get reimbursed at the end. Those were for makeup products I use and love, so I didn't mind buying them. \n\n**Insense**: There are a lot of gifted collabs on this app too, but you can also apply for any job on the site. I just did a gifted collab TikTok shop video for a face mask, and the company liked my video and has offered me two jobs at $150 per video. $150 isn't a ton, but I think I've made maybe $20 on TikTok Shop in the last month, so I'll take it lol.\n\n**Billo** is another I hear good things about, but haven't used yet. You have to upload an introduction video before it will let you see any of the available jobs and apply, and I haven't done that yet.\n\n**Kale** also looks interesting--you do \"missions\" for the brand, and the pay for those seems decent.\n\nYou might want to get a portfolio put together, because brands always seem to ask for it. I took a UCG for beginners course online that was really helpful, but all that info is probably out there for free too.",

You’re still building trust, learning marketing, pitching yourself, and understanding what brands want, it’s just that with UGC, you’re the product.\n\nDigital products, on the other hand, give you more leverage. You create or partner with something that solves a problem once and it can sell over and over without you having to trade time for money.  \nWhat’s worked best for me is the affiliate model. I promote high quality educational products that teach marketing, branding, content creation, even business growth. Every time someone buys through my recommendation, I earn a commission (mine averages around 350+.

Brands don’t pay for reach anymore; they pay for trust and niche relevance. Pick one theme your audience really vibes with, double down on that, and start treating your content like a mini brand, not a hobby. Once you’ve got that clear identity, even small collabs turn into long-term gigs. Most creators get stuck chasing numbers instead of building leverage.",

I started in 2019 posting TikToks on my own account and didn't really earn much from it even though I've been growing my account for years other than getting into TikTok shop.

Theres plenty of TikTok accounts of moms making food for their kids, doing mom housework etc. but you could stand out by cooking real good food. Most of those TikTok’s are just a woman heating up pizza pockets and pouring some chips onto a plate and calling it “lunch”. If you’re actually a good cook you could tap into that market. Show prep, show the cooking process for both your husband and kid’s food, show the cleanup, etc. brand them in different ways. Maybe one TikTok is about a quick meal you can make in 20m that’s still healthy. Make “games,” out of it for better content. For example, pull random ingredients out of your cupboards and pantry. Then cook a legit meal with those random ingredients. Title it something like “no groceries, no problem! A healthy weekday meal in 30 minutes with random ingredients from the pantry!” Or something. \n\nWhat do you post on your YouTube channel? Try double uploading when you make new videos/shorts. Instead of uploading only to YouTube you can use apps that will upload to multiple platforms at the same time. I’d start with YouTube shorts (as that sounds like what you’re making already) TikTok and Instagram reels\n\nRecord and edit multiple videos then schedule them as uploads. This way you can make a ton of content on that 1 day a week, then gradually publish them throughout the week until your next content creation day. Though obviously change outfits and etc so it seems like another day.",

Something else?\nAny of these, you can use. \nIn your own way, different with a twist to the usual norm that's out there.\nDo some research on what the market is missing - read between the lines &amp; stand out. \nThen, share &amp; build on your social page etc. &amp; make a profit.

They use the same skills you already have, just packaged differently and automated over time.\n\nI’ve seen moms across tiktok, etsy, instagram and even youtube build small but steady income streams this way, not overnight, but it compounds fast once you get traction. I got into that world myself after losing my job a while back (different niche, same idea), and honestly, it’s what gave me back some control over my schedule and income. You’ve already got the content and the skillset, maybe just a shift in how you use them.\n\nIf you research that space a bit, you’ll see a ton of creative ways moms are building flexibility into their lives.

My doorbell rang and I opened the door... A 20 year old woman, blond hair, maybe 120 lbs, in pink rubber overalls, long eyelashes and I swear there was glitter. She looked like Barbie. She said, I am here to fix your septic. I looked in the driveway for someone else, assuming she was assisting. Nope, all I say was a white and pink pickup truck. I went back in the house. 1 hour later doorbell rings. She said all fixed, she rebuilt biofilter and tested all systems. I had to ask. I told her I was not expecting her when I was told someone was coming. She said instead of going to college like her friends she worked entry level at a septic company making $20 per hour. Now, 3 years later she makes $45 per hour and %20 of all repairs. Last year she made just shy of $140k. She said they cant find enough employees.. And she makes 3x the $ her college graduate friends make. I have experienced the same thing before with an 18 year old HVAC tech, who made $75 per hour. Not enough people. And a 24 year old electrician. How is it possible not to make 100k as a yound healthy adult?",

      "selftext": "I wrote my newsletter for 50 days:\n\nHere are 50 things I’ve learned 👇\n1. It’s hard to write every day.\n2. I still don’t have a day where I preload them all.\n3. Consistency &gt; motivation.\n4. Nobody cares at first — and that’s freeing.\n5. Writing at 3 AM still counts.\n6. Kids getting sick will wreck your schedule, but you still hit send.\n7. One reader &gt; none.\n8. The only growth hack is showing up daily.\n9. I overthink subject lines more than anything.\n10. People open *stories*, not “tips.”\n11. Personal beats perfect.\n12. 80% of what you write will suck — publish anyway.\n13. Editing is optional when you’re being honest.\n14. Replies &gt; stats.\n15. You can sell nothing and still build something valuable.\n16. Failure stories connect more than success stories.\n17. The best lines come when you’re tired and done pretending.\n18. Posting to 5 platforms a day is overrated.\n19. Writing forces clarity.\n20. “Keep going” is cliché — but it’s the only rule that works.\n21. One sentence can change someone’s day.\n22. Chaos produces good writing if you let it.\n23. Every platform feels dead until something hits.\n24. The dopamine from new subs fades quick.\n25. You’ll want to quit every week.\n26. Every post feels pointless until someone says it helped them.\n27. AI can fix grammar but never voice.\n28. You find your niche by writing, not by planning.\n29. Boring days still deserve words.\n30. I refresh my sub count way too often.\n31. Family keeps me grounded when I spiral about growth.\n32. I owe everything to the habit, not the ideas.\n33. Money doesn’t make writing easier.\n34. Selling without selling feels better.\n35. Focusing on one thing beats chasing ten.\n36. Repetition *is* marketing.\n37. You build trust just by showing up.\n38. People buy consistency, not hype.\n39. I still don’t know what I’m doing — and that’s fine.\n40. Micro-wins compound.\n41. You can have a bad day and still hit publish.\n42. The right reader always finds you.\n43. Writing = therapy in public.\n44. Momentum &gt; speed.\n45. Authentic &gt; viral.\n46. Every word is a rep.\n47. You only learn what works *after* pressing send.\n48. A small audience is a secret weapon.\n49. The only real goal: write again tomorrow.\n50. 50 days in — still just getting started.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys. I'm not a business expert. I failed a lot before I figured this out. All the YouTube videos made it sound way too complicated.\n\nSo I'm writing this for people like me who just want a straight answer.\n\nThis is the simple, step-by-step way I started a dropshipping store that actually makes money. No confusing words, I promise.\n\nStep 1: Pick a Thing to Sell (The EASY Way)\n\nDon't try to sell everything. Sell ONE cool thing.\n\n· Where to look: Go on TikTok or Instagram and search \"Amazon finds\" or \"TikTok made me buy it.\" You're looking for products that are:\n  · Cool &amp; Impulsive: People see it and go \"Whoa, I need that!\" (e.g., a galaxy projector light, a custom portrait necklace, a cool kitchen gadget).\n  · Simple: Don't sell a complicated computer part.\n  · Under $40: Cheap enough that people buy without thinking too much.\n\nStep 2: Build Your \"Store\" (It's Just One Page)\n\nYou don't need a big, fancy website. You just need a single page that sells your ONE product. If you are anxious, simply search “Sitefy Dropship Websites” on google and get a prebuilt optimised store.\n\n· Use Shopify: It's the easiest. It's like building with Lego blocks. They have a free trial. Just drag and drop.\n· Name Your Store: Something simple like \"[YourProduct]Hub\" or \"Cool[YourProduct]Store.\"\n· Steal the Pictures &amp; Description: Go to AliExpress (this is where you'll buy the product from). Use the same pictures and description from there. Just rewrite a few sentences so it's not a direct copy.\n\nStep 3: The Secret Sauce: Make Dumb Videos\n\nThis is the most important part. You don't need to run confusing Facebook ads.\n\n· Make a TikTok/Instagram Reel: Film a video showing your product. SHOW, DON'T TELL.\n  · Example if you sell the galaxy projector: Just film your cool, starry room with some good music. No talking needed.\n  · Example if you sell a scrubber: Show it cleaning a dirty pan in 3 seconds.\n· The Caption: Write something simple like: \"Turn your room into a galaxy 🌌 [Link in Bio]\" or \"Cleans your whole pan in seconds 😮 [Link in Bio]\"\n· Post 1-3 videos like this EVERY DAY. Consistency is key.\n\nStep 4: When Someone Buys (The Magic Part)\n\n1. Customer buys from your store for $35.\n2. You go to AliExpress and buy the product for $10. You use the customer's name and address to ship it.\n3. You keep the $25 profit. You never touch the product. AliExpress ships it directly to your customer.\n\nStep 5: Repeat and Don't Quit\n\n· If your first product doesn't sell after a week, pick a new one and try again. It's a numbers game.\n· BONUS TIP: Once a product starts selling, you can spend $5-$10 a day on TikTok/Instagram ads to boost your best video.\n\nTL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read):\n\n1. Find 1 cool, cheap product on TikTok.\n2. Make a simple 1-page store on Shopify.\n3. Post simple videos of the product on TikTok/Instagram every day.\n4. When you get a sale, order it from AliExpress and pocket the difference.\n5. Don't give up.\n\nIt's not about being smart. It's about being consistent.\n\nYou can do this. Any questions? Ask in the comments, I'll try to keep the answers simple.",

Nobody is discovered overnight.  You COULD teach language online - and do this in conjunction with \"physical work\" as I've referenced above, as well as school.  Between the three things, you'd be busy and making money.\n\nI suggest turning your language talents into a career by looking into translation services online, as well as maybe the United Nations.

      "selftext": "I spent the last few months testing different passive options to see what actually works without needing constant attention, then I figured I'd share what I found since everyone's always asking about this stuff.\n\nsurvey/task apps\n\nFirst I tried prolific and mturk but these aren't really passive at all, you're basically working another job for like $5-8 an hour. Prolific pays better but tasks dry up fast, mturk is consistent but soul crushing, not truly passive so I didn't include them in the main testing.\n\ncashback apps\n\nIbotta and fetch require you to actively scan receipts which defeats the passive purpose entirely. Rakuten is better since it's browser based but you still have to actively remember to activate it before purchases which I forget half the time. I collected some points but nothing significant tbh.\n\ntraditional bandwidth sharing\n\nGrass is the main one everyone uses, just collects points right now and had an airdrop recently. Problem is it sits idle most of the time, like it’s only active when their network needs your bandwidth which is unpredictable, Some days it barely runs at all which is frustrating when you're trying to collect points. Honeygain and earnapp are similar, all pretty much the same utilization issues.\n\nstreaming-focused bandwidth\n\nIt’s a newer category that I recently found, it works during content watching instead of random requests which makes more sense for my usage, It includes an extension called rumi.io which runs when netflix or hbo are open, it’s way more consistent than grass or so, but it’s still just points at this point like grass was at the beginning, no guarantees but if it follows the same pattern as others, maybe there'll be something eventually.\n\nSo my personal opinion is that cashback stuff is fine if you remember to use it but it requires too much active thought to be truly passive. Survey apps aren't passive at all, just underpaid work basically..\n\nThe main takeaway is most \"passive\" income isn't really passive, you're either actively working for pennies or waiting for something to maybe activate.",

      "selftext": "The idea came from someone that runs a disney holidays comparison website. She makes about 3k a month from the website while working about 3-4 hours a month on it. Most of her traffic comes from SEO which means that she barely has any costs. She earns a commission when users book through her affiliate links to sites like Booking.com.\n\nThis sounds awesome but the intitial work she put in was massive. Months and months of content writing.\n\nFor the last year I've been deep diving in vibe coding. I have some previous experience with SEO. I heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well without grinding as much.  I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known. I expect to make about 1500 dollar a month from this project at the end of next year.\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was the split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no complex CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. So far the project looks incredibly promising. Will share more results once I have them.",

      "selftext": "Over the years, I explored many side hustles, including dropshipping, freelancing, affiliate marketing, and print-on-demand. I felt that whenever I discovered a promising opportunity, something kept me from pursuing it. Whether it was a complex technology, a disheartening market, or something else entirely, I kept running into barriers.\n\nFor the most part, I learned how to establish websites, develop ads, and master the marketing, but I simply wasn’t making any sales. I earned a few bucks here and there, enough to convince myself I was building a proper business, but it was so erratic and inconsistent that it hardly felt like I was constructing anything with real value.\n\nI learned how to reduce the steps I needed to take in order to begin making a profit, and this made all the difference. I identified a niche market for products I could easily acquire, which made it possible for me to concentrate on building the store and doing the marketing, all without the hassle of inventory, packing, or shipping. I was able to keep the expenses low and avoid any overly complex technology.\n\nI started an online store for easy-to-source, in-demand products. I set up my store and automated portions of my business using AI-powered tools. I could list all my products, set prices, and arrange store layout in just a couple of minutes. I felt like I was finally getting there.\n\nThe first sale was monumental and from there I was able to shift my focus to product marketing and optimizing my ads. Over time my sales started to increase consistently and I honed my skills in overall process optimization. I began my store with a small inventory of predominantly accessories and home décor and gradually added products after identifying market demand.\n\nThe journey was not easy, but my efforts paid off. I built a low-risk, low-cost business by focusing on products for which I could avoid manufacturing and storage. With everything in place, I was able to avoid technical distractions and focus on increasing my business scale.\n\nIf you’re over 35 and seeking solutions, I understand. I have gone through years of trial and error, and it is only recently that I have been able to where I want to be. But once I found my niche and acquired the appropriate tools to streamline the process, all the pieces started to fall into place. I now operate my online store full-time, earning more than I did during my 9-5, and have been able to create something that is profitable, sustainable, and in my control, which is a rewarding experience.",

          "body": "You’re right to call out the hype. Most “passive” plays are either thinly veiled affiliate promos or labor-intensive side businesses that only feel passive after heavy upfront work. The forex replies here reinforce the problem: unlimited upside claims ignore risk, drawdowns, and the operational stress of active trading. And the linked survey and crypto pages are essentially low-yield churn or gambling, not durable income streams.\n\nA more pragmatic lens is to evaluate opportunities by four variables: ongoing maintenance load, reliable distribution, platform dependency risk, and capital intensity. Dividends from broad ETFs score well because ops load is low and distribution is built in. Modestly scoped SaaS with annual billing can be semi-passive if retention and support stay manageable. Evergreen content or IP that ranks for stable search intent can compound, provided you avoid platform whiplash. Real estate becomes semi-passive with competent property management, but capital and local risk matter.\n\nTakeaway: define “passive” as income decoupled from your time after a build phase, then choose one asset where you can win on distribution and retention, not hype. If you cannot clearly outline maintenance, acquisition, and platform risks in a one-page model, it is not passive.",

      "selftext": "The reason I am writing this here is because over the years I’ve seen people say they have never made money online after trying the most popular methods.\n\nWhile that might be true, I can boldly tell you that you are your number one problem. You try everything for few days or maybe 2 months and then you quit because you don’t see results, so how will you make money??\n\nMost of you have tried affiliate marketing, freelancing, CPA, etc. Guess what, you made $0. \n\nThe main reason is because you are either not taking action or you’re taking actions on the wrong things. For example, if you want to make money online with freelancing, you must know how to position yourself where the demand is and the skills/supply is limited. That’s how you make money on sites like Fiverr, upwork, etc.\n\nFor affiliate marketing, you can’t be promoting what everyone is promoting using free traffic and expect to make a dime, it doesn’t work that way. Promote a new product with paid traffic or with a strategic free traffic source like your own facebook group, YouTube channel, TikTok page, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is your twist to the process that makes you money. For example recently I started promoting a browser and I made money online the first day. This is because the product is new and it is something people would be interested in.\n\nMy advice to anyone who is serious with making money online is that you should start by promoting value before you promote and offer. Only try free traffic if the product you’re promoting is Free.\n\nI’ll end my rant here!!\n\nAsk me questions if any.\n\n\nI come in peace.",

      "selftext": "So, quick backstory: I left my software dev job about 6 months ago. Sometimes feel like the worst decision of my life but whatever. I liked programming itself but hated everything around it. The meetings, the fake enthusiasm, the DSA grind every time you switch jobs, the feeling that nothing you build actually matters. I was an average dev and just couldn’t see myself doing the whole “leetcode 200 questions” cycle again, and that too for the REST OF MY MISERBALE LIFE. (Sorry if I offended any sw devs, but please bare with me, I just can't with this job anymore).\n\nAfter 3 years full-time I decided I’d had enough. Took a month off to reset and didn’t even open my laptop.\n\nThen I started thinking about what I actually enjoy. I’ve always loved puzzles. Sudoku, cryptograms, riddles, logic stuff, all thanks to my dad. He would come home from work and first thing he picked was the newspaper to solve crosswords.. He used to tell me, “You gotta move your brain as much as you move your body,” never really understood what it meant when I was child but now I see it.\n\nSo I built something around that. I made something that people like me will enjoy. A puzzle kit where you can solve puzzles and ultimately the mystery.\n\n# How it started\n\nGot together with 2 of my friends who were just as do-nothing as me. One's working on deciding the storyline, one on marketing and one on coding. The first release in June sold 5 copies. I almost quit right there, but instead decided to tweak everything. Reworked the puzzles, improved the design, rewrote some of the story, and re-released it. That version sold 454 copies. Not life-changing money, but 454 x $25 is a solid amount for a small team where we live.\n\nWe put everything we made back into the next version. We’ve just released version 3 about 10–12 days ago, and we’re already past 150 sales. I know it might sound small, but for three people who used to show up late to the office, miss deadlines, and constantly disappoint  families, even 2 sales felt like a win at one point.\n\n# What worked for us\n\n**1. Researching the market**  \nWe spent time reading forums and watching how people talk about puzzles. Found out that most puzzle lovers actually want a story or some sense of progression, not just random brain teasers. That’s how we came up with the idea of a connected mystery instead of a random puzzle pack.\n\n**2. Understanding the audience**  \nWe lurked in puzzle communities, ARG groups, and subreddits just to listen. Turns out, people didn’t want super hardcore escape-room puzzles. They wanted something relaxing but clever. That feedback changed our tone and visuals completely. We're constantly working on improving our storylines. \n\n**3. Studying competitors**  \nWe bought a few puzzle kits from bigger names and paid attention to what worked and what didn’t. A lot of them had either great puzzles with boring stories or great stories with lazy puzzles. We tried to strike a balance. But hey, they're doing something right!\n\n# Marketing (our toughest dragon to slay)\n\n**YouTube** – Tried posting short funny puzzle-related videos, but our channel got deleted because YT said we were “trying to take traffic off-platform.” That was a big loss because we actually saw a small bump from it before it went down ( I know, our fault, should've read the guidelines before, but who has time for that). Might create another one without actually trying to steal their audience.\n\n**Reddit** – Surprisingly helpful. Our first few posts here got a bit of traction and led to real customers. Had few lashbacks as well, cuz we were sounding too much like an ad. Think about the customers, before you think about the product.\n\n**Discord** – Still trying to figure it out. We made a small community but engagement is low (0). Probably need to give people more reasons to hang around beyond just solving puzzles. We're actively working on figuring out how to not just sell puzzles but actually create a community.\n\n**Twitter** – Haven't fully started. Still trying to figure this out.\n\n**Instagram / Meta ads** – This was the biggest driver of traffic. We ran small $10–$20/day ads and kept testing creatives. What worked best were short clips of the puzzles with captions like “Can you solve this?” followed by a mystery hook.\n\n**Hiring** – Hired winners from 2nd puzzle to work for us for promotion. They're learning, so are we. We have decided to hire more.\n\n# Where we’re at now\n\nWe’ve saved enough to last a few months and we’re using all business income for business expenses. The goal is to grow a small but loyal community instead of chasing quick sales.\n\nIt’s still early, and we have no idea if this will turn into something considerable, but it’s the first time in years we’ve actually been excited to wake up and work.\n\n3 \"devs\" , trying to figure out something other than being passed commands and then chatgpting the solution. Hoping we won't ever have to go back to office chairs, teams calls (I can still hear their audio in my head), waking up feeling scared if today will be the day I'll be thrown out. I mean, we are jobless right now as well, and we're not earning as much as we used too, but happiness matters right? Right ???",

          "body": "A decent side hustle I've been doing that has worked this year is looking for offers from banks or apps where the bonus reward is higher than any initial cost. It's a form of arbitrage, and it can make you an extra couple hundred each month. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives those offers higher, creating more opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how it works.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them. I usually just use the [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) site for whatever current arbitrage offers they have listed. It's a free resource.",

          "body": "OP is right to be wary. Most “side hustle” content optimizes for views, not outcomes. A few thoughts from building small products and testing arbitrage plays:\n\nBank and app bonuses can work, but they are seasonal and administrative. The bonusarb guide currently highlights SoFi Plus where you spend $10 and get $30 back, and a higher payout Chime offer that requires redirecting an employer direct deposit to earn around $390. These stack, but you need to track terms, KYC, payout timing, and tax implications. The aggregator they reference (Gemsloot) handles offer tracking and withdrawals; still, incentives change and dry up when the acquisition budget shifts.\n\nVideo editing is a better bet if you niche down. Short-form repurposing for local businesses or niche creators is not saturated when you anchor to outcomes: editing pipeline, caption templates, hooks per industry, and weekly analytics. Distribution matters more than craft alone.\n\nOffline, vending is capital intensive but can be defensible with the right placements. Expect a grind in securing locations and negotiating splits before it feels passive.\n\nIf you want “slow growth” with low cash, pick one skill with compounding leverage, aim for repeatable deliverables, and attach to an existing demand stream. Arbitrage is fine for quick wins. Durable income comes from owning a tight problem and a simple system to solve it.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

We both speak English fluently.\n\nSince we live in an apartment (no house, no garage, etc.), we’re trying to figure out what kind of side project or online work would actually make sense for us.\n\nHaving an online income still feels almost like science fiction — whenever I look into it, it seems like everything is already oversaturated. Dropshipping, for example, feels like it’s long past its prime.\n\nWe’ve thought about learning programming or website building, but the time investment seems huge, and honestly, it feels like every teenager or twenty-something already has a head start.\n\nThat said, we *are* willing to learn new skills — we just don’t know which ones are truly worth investing our time and effort in.\n\nWe don’t have a big budget (definitely not €50,000 to invest), but we’re motivated, disciplined, and ready to put in steady work.\n\nWhat would you recommend for people like us who want to start small, learn something valuable, and maybe build a modest but meaningful online income?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or inspiration!",

          "body": "Online business is hard, sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But that shouldn’t put you off. Just don’t go into it expecting overnight success. Think of it as a journey a place to be creative, experiment, and be okay with failing fast so you can learn what doesn’t work.\n\nStart with your “why.” Why do you want to do this, and who do you want to help? Define your ideal customer, the lifestyle you want, and what your business should look like in 5–10 years. Then break that vision down into small, manageable steps you can take one at a time.\n\nAll businesses share the same core structure: marketing, sales, operations, and cash flow. Cash flow is what keeps you in the game without it, even the best idea fails. So you need to understand your margins, because that’s what drives profit and profit is what lets you grow and scale sustainably.\n\nThe key is to find a niche where you can stand out. Be better at something, improve something, or serve a specific type of customer in a unique way. Focus on building a brand because brands create trust, and trust allows you to charge more than your competitors. Without a brand, your only advantage is price, and that’s a race to the bottom.\n\nFinally, test everything. Start small, see what gets traction, and double down on what works. No one will tell you what’s working right now that’s the business world’s best-kept secret but everyone will tell you what used to work.",

After that organic growth will follow year after year with 0 extra time investment.\n\nNow first thing is to find your product and your niche.

It doesn't have the potential to scale to something huge like starting your own business, but those things can also just end up paying nothing. There are lots of platforms, with varying rates, rules, structure, etc. Data Annotation Tech, Mercor, Mindrift, Telus International are some. You can search reddit and find huge lists of companies that hire for this and then look for what suits you best. You don't need to learn new skills. You do need to be detail-oriented and meticulous, reading and following the instructions and checking back about this frequently.",

          "body": "You are right to be wary of dropshipping and “overnight” plays. A realistic path for an apartment-friendly side income is to start with a narrow, outcome-based service that compounds into assets. Pick one customer profile where you already have familiarity, then offer a clear result such as “launch a fast WordPress store in 7 days with basic SEO and Stripe.” The WooCommerce plus Elementor stack is free to start, low friction, and gives you speed and control without deep coding.\n\nUse her sales strength to run short, targeted outreach to 30 prospects in that niche. Keep it human and specific: problem, outcome, timeline, price. Your tech role is delivery and iteration. Track three numbers from day one: response rate, conversion rate, and delivery hours. When you can repeat the same workflow reliably, turn the process into a productized package and a simple checklist, then add a small upsell like basic email capture or a one-page SEO refresh.\n\nIf you want a purely side income stream to bridge the early months, data annotation platforms can be a pragmatic filler, but they are not passive and quality varies. Treat them as temporary cash flow, not a core business.",

(See picture in the link for proof.) At first I wasn’t making as much but if you’re willing to invest a bit or time and money, you can easily get your money back fairly quickly. I broke even around 6 months. Now I can’t guarantee any specific time frame, just because there are so many factors, but it’s def possible. So how does it work? The investments you make are for actually physical real miners that the company holds in a number of warehouses (and you can even watch a live stream of the miners and can see whenever someone is working on them) and takes care of them. So investment literally buy you actual miners (but you won’t have to deal with any maintenance or electricity. We pay the company a small percentage of our earnings to cover all that. So you could literally sign up, buy your first miner, set it to reinvest in TH (more TH = More $), and just leave it in a closet and it will continue to make you money! Now it’s not going to be the quickest option, but the point is that your account just continues to get more and more profitable over time. Plus, they are just really a great company to work with!\n\nIf any of you are at all interested in signing up, please just DM me here or on Discord at: Smaug\\_LegendsOTM and I’ll help answer any questions/guidance you might have/need, including how to sign up and get the most benefits right off the top!

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training glfrom beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free! At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

Especially since I'm studying something irrelevant to what I actually want to do.\n\nA few months ago I started doing remote work for a small startup (Vidcoin - www. vidcoin .ai), they pay people to record short audio or video clips that help train AI models. On a good month I can earn 2k, usually about 30/hr depending on the project and if I put my mind to it.\n\nIt started as a small side gig, but it made me realize I actually can make decent money online. Now I can’t stop thinking about whether I could turn this into something full-time or move into other kinds of online work like e-commerce, freelancing, or anything else that’s flexible.\n\nI’m not trying to chase easy money, I just feel like I’d learn more building things and experimenting than sitting through lectures that don’t connect to anything. Also, the corporate world sounds horrible for me and my mental health.\n\nFor anyone who’s dropped out, freelances full-time, or runs something online:\n\nHow did you figure out what to focus on? Did you wait until you were making enough to drop out, or just go for it?\n\nNot trying to promote anything here, just trying to figure out my next move.

Not only because your comparative is inaccurate, but more importantly because you want to avoid any implication that you are providing any type of medical treatment for legal reasons. You’d want to make it very clear you are not in any way shape or form a doctor or licensed counselor and that it was purely for entertainment purposes only. \n\nAlso finding a “sugar daddy” to fund your business idea is not as easy as you think so maybe take that one out of your head entirely. It’d make your post at least come across with a little more maturity and less attention seeking desperation.",

You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you're essentially exploiting this to your advantage. Competition (companies outbidding each other for signups) drives offers higher, creating more arbitrage opportunities.\n\nFor example, a company might pay you $30 to subscribe to something that might only cost $10. You can take advantage of it and profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes, which is how arbitrage works. \n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me pay my grocery bill. The only tricky part is really just finding these types of opportunities before everyone else flocks to them and ruins them.

No gambling involved, just some basic math and patience. You’ll need some starting cash (around €800 is okay), but once you get the hang of it, it can actually turn into a nice consistent income. And i say this to you cause I do this for because I have been doing this for almost 2 years and monthly I fluctuate between €4000 and €6000 per month but the relatively interesting thing is that it is a method of earning that is risk-free because mainly what you do is cover all the outcomes of that match obviously using other bookmakers so you have the security not only of not losing the money you have bet but of unlocking the bonus in real balance.",

          "body": "You can absolutely make money online, but be careful with ideas that hinge on health outcomes. “Grow taller” guides can violate platform rules around medical and body transformation claims, which risks takedowns and account loss. If you experiment with TikTok, frame content as general wellness or habit-building and avoid promises of physical changes.\n\nOn “clipping,” it usually means turning long videos or podcasts into short, high-retention clips for TikTok, Reels, or Shorts. The playbook is simple: pick a niche, study winning hooks, batch-edit in CapCut or Canva, and post consistently. It works best when your edits are genuinely transformative, not just reposts, so add structure, subtitles, context, or commentary to avoid reuse penalties.\n\nSince you want a remote income to cover student needs, consider parallel tracks:\n\n* **Low risk income:** customer chat support, transcription, data labeling, or basic QA testing.\n* **Creator services:** offer clipping, thumbnail design, or captioning to small creators who do not have short-form workflows.\n* **Digital products:** study demand-first PDFs or Notion templates, then ship fast, price modestly, and iterate on feedback.\n\nQuick takeaway: avoid health claims, make your content transformative, and pair a creator-service with a straightforward remote role to stabilize cash flow while your audience or product ramps.",

          "body": "I recently starting working as a court transcriptionist, which is fully remote. I am technically still in training, which lasts a month or two (depends on how fast you are). \n\nI am sent court audio files, and I am supposed to transcribe them into a specific format, which can take a bit of time. It pays $2 per page, each page usually has between 200-300 words on it, and so how much you get paid depends on how fast you can type. If the audio file is clear, I can do some pages in one minute, but if the audio is hard to hear and I have to go back and listen over and over, it can take several minutes. And then you have to go back and proof read and make sure the formatting is right, which adds to the time. \n\nIt's obviously better if you can type fast, I'm only at 65 wpm (slow for this kind of work), but there's room to grow and get better. I bought a foot pedal to pause audio, which also helps with speed. It was $70, but definitely worth it! I bought two other cheaper ones that didn't work with the audio software. Other than that, I have not paid anything for this job, not the classes or training. \n\nOverall, I am liking it. It is fully remote, I'm even allowed to travel, and I don't have to \"work\" with anyone except over email or zoom for instructions/ classes. There are no benefits like healthcare, it's contractor work (1099), and you have to pay your own taxes, but you also get to set your own schedule. As long as you submit the transcript before it's due, you're free to work as much or little as you want. \n\nAnother downside to consider, you are listening to court cases that contain sensitive information and details of crimes. Not for everyone, and can be difficult to listen to sometimes. \n\nI'm only a month into training, so still new. Hopefully it works out. I was also doing freelance transcription work, which is remote and doesnt cost anything to start. It pays a lot less, but it's also less strict, and a lot of the audios are short and easy.",

I'm supposed to have a virtual orientation tomorrow on Nov 7th. My first day is supposed to be Wednesday the 12th. Training is onsite, but afterwards I'll work from home except for twice a month. It doesn't quite feel real, but I did my fingerprints, drug testing, and background, hr paperwork etc..\n\nUpdate: I just finished my orientation and it IS a real job ladies and gentlemen! I start Wednesday. Orientation was virtual and I was in a group of 4 other people. A recruiter working for Randstad Staffing reached out to me via Indeed on 8.10.25. originally I was not selected for the class, after 1 interview with m the recruiter and the company and the recruiter reached out with the denial and told me if I was available he would try to get me in the next one. I received a call about a week later asking if I was still interested. I scheduled a second interview with the hiring manager and I thought it went well, but it was a full week before I heard anything about the job directly. While waiting for that, I completed my background check, and then scheduled my drug test and fingerprinting. Those things were completed before I received confirmation that I was accepted into the class from my recruiter. The date on my testing was 10.7.25. They gave me a possible class date of November back in one of my initial interviews. I'll be working for Wells Fargo on a 1 year contract in Tier 2 Escalation and Case Management. They said expect 10-12 calls and to manage 30-50 new cases a day, so I'm expecting a heavy workload, but not necessarily heavy phone time. I'm okay with phone time, but Wells Fargo is providing all equipment including the computer and Internet some of which I have to bring back and forth when WFH or WIO.  I'll be making 25.50 an hour with full time hours and the option for overtime. It's been a two month process.",

I brushed it off because Pinterest seemed like a platform for recipes and home decor, not finance content.\n\nAfter 8 months my blog was still under 500 monthly visitors from Google. SEO is slow and competitive in finance niche.\n\nFinally tried Pinterest out of desperation. Created 20 pins, joined some Communities via Tailwind, posted consistently for 30 days.\n\nMonth 1 results:\n\n- 1,847 visitors from Pinterest\n- 89 email subscribers\n- 2 affiliate commissions\n\nPinterest traffic in one month exceeded 8 months of SEO traffic. I wasted 8 months ignoring my friend's advice because of assumptions about what Pinterest was for.\n\nNow at month 6:\n\n- 8.2K monthly Pinterest visitors\n- 450 email subscribers total\n- $340 monthly affiliate income\n\nPinterest is my main traffic source now. Google brings maybe 600 visitors monthly while Pinterest brings 8K+.\n\nThe lesson: Don't dismiss platforms based on stereotypes. Test them and see actual results.\n\nWish I'd started Pinterest when my friend first suggested it. Would be 6 months ahead now.\n\nWhat advice did you ignore that you later regretted?

But the reduction of friction is real.\n\n**Question for Folks here**\n\n* Is anyone else using Telegram as part of your content stack?\n* Are you chaining bots? How?\n* Are you using Telegram mainly for idea generation or for output polishing?\n* Does it actually stick as a daily routine?\n\nBy the way, some of these bots are built by me and some by friends in the community who shared their work with me.\n\nIf anyone wants the full list with links you can just comment below or DM me.\n\nHappy to share my work.",

      "selftext": "The idea came from someone that runs a disney holidays comparison platform. She makes about 3k a month from the website while working about 3-4 hours a month on it. Most of her traffic comes from SEO. The revenue model is mainly affiliate commissions.\n\nI heard about her succesfull project and thought well I can do that as well. I'll let AI do the website coding (no wordpress or CMS) and the content writing (using markdown format).\n\nThere are javascript libaries that allow you to load markdown as SEO optimized content on a web project. Lots of frontend developers have blogs that use this structure. Yet this structure is barely used in the affiliate marketing/SEO world.\n\nOf course I couldnt just copy her niche, that wouldnt be fair so I came up with a similiair yet different niche. A theme park the size of a disney theme park but a little less known.\n\nSomething to point out here is that her (and my) platform are not in English. This makes it a lot easier to rank due to less competition and lower content saturation in that language market.\n\n# Building the website\n\nMy first step was to create a rock-solid plan. I spent a few hours outlining a detailed, phased plan for the entire project. This document detailed the exact frontend folder structure, the required reusable components like headers and footers. (all done with the help of my friend Google Gemini). next step was to split the plan in different phases and let my AI assistants complete the development for each phase.\n\n# Content writing\n\nWhile the coding AI was churning out pages, I put another AI to work on the content. I gave it the topics and keywords, and it wrote all the descriptions for the accommodations close to the theme park, the SEO texts for the pages, and several blog posts, all formatted in Markdown. This content is loaded directly into the website (using mdx), no CMS needed.\n\nFrom the initial idea to a fully functional, content-rich website deployed on Vercel for free, the entire process took just under two weeks.\n\nI'm currently letting Google index my project and have more content to be published in my pipeline. Will give an update in a few months.\n\n ",

It’s not even about trust it’s just realizing how fast something you built from scratch can get tangled up in stuff that has nothing to do with work.   \nI’m in a serious relationship now and things are good, but for the first time, I’ve actually caught myself thinking about stuff like prenups or protecting ownership. Never thought I’d be that person, but here we are.\n\nAny other business owners hit that point where you start looking at marriage a little differently once there’s a company involved?",

They outline the finer details you may have glossed over. Everyone just thinks their loved one will be “fair”. But stating it is just so vague. What’s fair to you and your loved one?

          "body": "When we talk about Tesla's value, we're talking about their market capitalization - \"market cap\" for short. Market cap is the price of an individual share of the company multiplied by the number of shares owned and traded by shareholders - these shares are also call \"outstanding shares\". \n\nSo, market cap = share price x outstanding shares. \n\nAs I type this, Tesla's share price is $428.79 and they have 3.33 *billion* outstanding shares, making their market cap roughly $1.428 *trillion*.\n\nOver the next decade, Musk has been tasked by the board to lead Tesla to hit certain goals. As he reaches each of these goals, he unlocks a portion of his compensation which is a mix of cash and equity (aka shares of Tesla). If  Tesla hits a certain number of goals by year 5, he'll receive the compensation amounts tied to those goals at the 7.5 year mark. If he hits all the other goals in time, he'll receive the rest of his compensation at the ten year mark provided he hasn't left the company.\n\nAmong his goals is increasing the Tesla share price so that the company's market cap exceeds $8 trillion - an almost 6x increase from today. Most of his compensation will be in equity and will increase his ownership in the company to (I believe) 29% - about double what he owns now. So in 2035, his assets may be worth over $2 trillion.",

I'm not saying this is right or wrong, just highlighting that we're already past any notion of this being simply about growing the company's assets.\n\nTesla are also facing significantly more competition than ever before - they've lost a lot of their 'edge' simply to the fact that many other EV manufacturers are now into their own second and third generation models, and most of the innovation that drove early Tesla popularity is starting to look a little dated. Again, this isn't a negative or positive comment on Tesla, just to point out that it's not simply a case of business as usual for them.\n\nMusk will have to really drive the company forward exponentially, and make the move into wider battery-related consumer products, where they still have a competitive advantage, to even get close to this valuation.\n\nSo, if they manage that new valuation, and regardless of anyone's personal opinions on Musk, he will undoubtedly be a major part of that growth, even though it's a truly disgusting amount of money, he'll have earned it.",

Therefore, I suspect this compensation package serves as a message: \"We can offer you the moon if you deliver results, or you can just leave and focus on your xAI and Grok projects while we work on making Tesla a more trustworthy company and get back some customers leaving us just because they hate you.\"",

Not criticizing you for wanting to learn and know more or being skeptical, but it would make more sense if you understood the underlying business behind the deal rather than the fake news and social media.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur (assuming since you are on this subreddit) then you should understand or at least try to understand a little bit about business. One of the questions I have regarding pay packages such as this one is I wonder if Elon will be paid his bonus regardless of whether or not he in fact hits his sales targets. It's my understanding that bonuses like this are typically paid despite whether someone hits targets or not out of professional courtesy. Can someone with more experience clarify this?\n\nObviously it depends on the size and complexity of the deal. A $1,000 Christmas bonus gets paid out way more consistently than something like this, but how are professional courtesy deals for bonuses handed out at the extreme levels like the CEO pay package deal of a big firm like Tesla or even smaller (like mid cap or small cap or microcap)",

          "body": "Be comfortable with the idea that you will fail.. because you will. Being ok with failure will set you free. Just don't be comfortable with the idea of giving up. Failing is one thing, but giving up is shameful. I tried 5 different entrepreneurial ideas before 1 actually landed. I spent 10s of thousands of dollars, found out who my real friends were and sacrificed my \"Fridays with the boys.\" I would be happy to do it all over again because the one idea I had that landed paid me back 10x long term and has given me more time with my family than I could have ever dreamed of. It's similar to the military in a way. If you sign up and they tell you to do 100 push ups, you do 100 push ups regardless of how long it takes. You could sit there and do 1 every 60 seconds. You could do 2 every 20 minutes. You are not leaving until 100 have been completed because that was the goal. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, then you will be an entrepreneur. There will be no excuses because your mind won't be able to comprehend it. It's ok to be nervous, it's not ok to never start. If you think it's not for you, then it probably isn't. Have you ever heard a professional athlete say in an interview that they didn't think the sport was for them? No, the first thing they say is they are going to win the championship. If they don't win the championship, they say there's always next year. The goal of an entrepreneur isn't to be the guy in a suit, a $2M mansion, and 6 cars in the garage. If that's why you are doing it, then you will never succeed. The goal of an entrepreneur is to solve people's problems.",

You are the one that needs to make that final call, decision etc. Nobody is there to help you.\n\nPeople get jealous - for this reason, keep everything very private. Especially revenue numbers. Most people just don't understand revenue / gp / np. They look at revenue only and have no idea.\n\nFriends and family etc are not really supporting you. They will be very skeptical. They will be expecting you to fail. They often will not act in a way that will help you.\n\nYou only truly fail when you quit. I have seen so many small business owners start and do ok, but don't have what it takes to keep going when it is a pure grind. It gets boring, very uncomfortable and not worth it. Until you get to a point where you are at a comfortable revenue / gp level that makes sense. You have to be in it for the long haul. For most this is 5+ years.\n\n Many people you deal with are not compatible with you or your company. This goes for customers, staff, friends / family and quite often other businesses. It's fine, don't take anything personally and just move on. Only deal with people that are good, isolate yourself from anyone else however hard that is.\n\nWhen and if you are successful, keep it to yourself. It's nobody's business but your own. The less people you tell, the better your life will be. Most people don't understand money and taxes, especially at a higher level. So if you make a million dollars for example, they would think you are rich. In reality you would need to give away so much of that money to take it, that it is not worth it. Especially when considering the missed opportunities you have when the government takes half of it.\n\nYou are always better off being honest and ethical. People and businesses that do not take this very seriously do not last.",

          "body": "Hitting **$2M** in your first year with **26% net margins** and earning investor confidence is not accidental. The title change just exposes a new surface area of decisions. Imposter feelings usually fade when you replace vague pressure with precise operating rhythms. Define your weekly leadership cadence around a few leading indicators that you personally own: qualified pipeline added, customer retention by cohort, payback period on acquisition, and cash runway movement. Keep a short decision journal so you can revisit how you framed choices and what you learned. Build a simple narrative report for your partners each month that ties outcomes to bets, risks, and next actions. That practice compounds credibility with yourself first.\n\nAt the team level, clarify two or three CEO responsibilities that only you can do: set focus, allocate capital, and hire or fire standards. Everything else is delegated with clear success criteria. When impostor thoughts pop up, audit your inputs rather than your identity. Are your customer conversations frequent and structured? Are you segmenting profitability and killing weak lines quickly? Are you running postmortems on misses and publicly adopting the fix?\n\nYou do not need to feel like a CEO to operate like one. Put a simple system in place, let results update the story, and let the title catch up later.",

I've been messing around with n8n for like 3-4 months now, mostly just building random shit for myself because I'm a nerd and it's fun.\n\nLast month I'm sitting in Starbucks (yeah yeah I know) trying to look productive, and this real estate lady next to me is VENTING to her friend about how she keeps missing leads. Like she's legitimately stressed about it. Something about Zillow inquiries coming in at weird hours and by the time she sees them the next day, people have already connected with other agents.\n\nNow normally I mind my own business but I'd literally just watched a tutorial on webhook automations the night before so I'm like... I could fix that? So I do the awkward lean-over thing and I'm like \"sorry I couldn't help overhearing but I actually build automation stuff, I might be able to help?\"\n\nShe looked at me like I was trying to sell her a timeshare lmao but she gave me her business card anyway.\n\nWhat I actually built her: Basic webhook setup to catch form submissions from her website. Auto-reply email that goes out in like a minute saying \"thanks I got your message, I'll hit you back soon\". Everything dumps into a Google Sheet so she can see all her leads in one place. Her phone gets an SMS whenever a new lead comes in (she LOVED this part). If she doesn't check off that she contacted them within 24hrs, they get an automatic follow-up.\n\nHonest to god it took me maybe 6 hours? And half of that was me googling \"how to format SMS in n8n\" and troubleshooting why the webhook kept timing out , seems i had wrong webhook.\n\nI charged her $450 because I literally had no idea what to charge and that felt like a big number but not TOO big ya know?\n\nPlot twist: Two weeks later she calls me HYPED. Apparently a lead came through at like 11pm on a Saturday night - she was already in bed but got the text, sent a quick reply from her phone, and ended up closing the deal. The commission? Twelve. Thousand. Dollars.\n\nShe literally said \"you just paid for yourself like 25 times over\" and then referred me to two other agents in her office.\n\nIf you're thinking about doing this: Dude just start. Real estate agents need basic stuff, not rocket science. Maybe do a cheap/free first project to get a testimonial and build confidence. These people have actual budgets if you save them time. You don't need to be some automation god, you just gotta solve an actual problem they have.\n\nAnyway I'm rambling but I'm just hyped because this actually worked. Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try this!",

You've nailed something crucial: the real estate agent pain point is ROI-simple (\"I lost a $12k commission because I missed 11pm\"), which makes it easy to justify payment.\n\n\n\nHere's where this scales:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Immediate opportunities:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Recurring revenue model\\*\\*: $99-299/month is nothing for an agent saving 1-2 commissions/year. That $450 one-time fee should become $150/mo (or tiered by number of lead sources they connect).\n\n\n\n2. \\*\\*Expand vertically fast\\*\\*: Service businesses with \"speed-to-respond\" problems are everywhere - HVAC contractors, plumbers, electricians, car detailing, cleaning services. Google Local Service Ads rewards fastest responders. Same problem, same solution.\n\n\n\n3. \\*\\*Don't just build for one person\\*\\*: Once you have 2-3 case studies in the same vertical, that's your entry point to sell into their networks/associations.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Key growth levers:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Real estate agents have referral networks. One happy agent = 20 referrals in their office\n\n\\- Service contractors all talk to each other at supply shops, trade events\n\n\\- Industry-specific Facebook groups are goldmines for warm outreach\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The catch:\\*\\* If you stay at $450 per client doing custom work, you cap out. The winning path is building 1-2 standardized solutions, documenting the setup process, then selling it at $99-299/month with light support.\n\n\n\nYou've proven the concept. Now systematize it. This could easily become 5-6 figures/year if you focus on one vertical for the next 90 days.",

Best investments I've made were in markets with 5-10 established players. Shows there's money flowing and customers willing to pay\n\n4.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just need to get this off my chest because I’m honestly so frustrated with trying to make money. I started when I was 14, just looking for any way to earn online. I tried CPA, affiliate marketing, freelancing you name it. None of it clicked for me. The only things that brought in a little cash were surveys and game offers, and even then, the pay wasn’t great.\n\nI’ve been jumping from one thing to another, just hoping to find something that actually works for me. I really don’t have the time or energy to throw into something that eats up my whole day. Things are rough, I can barely afford food or basics. No matter how hard I try, I keep hitting dead ends.\n\nI even decided to focus on something I actually care about, just to see if it felt better. So, I built a Chrome extension that helps people where their researches. A few people used it, it even got featured , but honestly, it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not expecting to blow up with thousands of users, but it’s tough not to feel like I wasted all that time. It took me 4-5 months to finish that extension while seeking help on Discord Servers.\n\nI feel like a failure sometimes, especially when I look at how much time I’ve put in for almost nothing. I can’t even cover my basic needs, and finding a job feels impossible and I've applied to over a hundred jobs and nothing’s landed. I’m not asking to get rich, just want to be able to handle my own stuff without stressing about every little thing.\n\nI’m actually pretty good at computer repairs, so I tried offering my services on platforms like Fiverr, but my gig barely got any attention. Then I switched to cryp-to, and wow, so many scammers out there just trying to take your money with zero intention of helping. Funny enough, the only thing that made me any real money was gambling. I made about a hundred bucks, but I had to quit before it I become addicted. Seriously, don’t mess with gambling, so it’s not worth it.\n\nSome nights I can’t even sleep because my mind just keeps running in circles about all this stuff. I’m burned out, anxious, and it feels like I’m never going to hit my goal.\n\nI can accept failures, but I just need to find something sustainable that I can visualize it in a way that will be guaranteed.\n\nSorry for the long rant. I know it’s not your problem, and maybe it’s annoying to read, but I just needed to say it. I’m 18, by the way.",

But if you want to \"train\" to become an entrepreneur one day, you have to learn how to sell [3].\nIf you don't have a technical background to build stuff, look for a role in sales at a company ideally technology because it's lucrative, fast paced and you'll get exposure to build your social capital. If it's not an option retail can help to start building your sales skills. Not only will this give you the real skill set you'll realistically need as a business owner, but it can give you some cash and capital to give you some breathing room. \n\nGetting a job:\n\nWhy do people hire employees? Because their trying to delegate and scale their business through human labour. \n\nWhat does a business do? It generates value for customers by solving their problems in exchange for money. Instead of making a hamburger yourself you go to MacDonalds because it's a system that focuses on solving a problem: fast, affordable, convenient, consistent quality. \n\nHow can you stand out in \"applying for a job\"? Think like a contrarian and get creative (also a good skillset of an entrepreneur).\n\nQ: If 40K people are applying through the same job posting, how can you differentiate yourself? \n\nA: By not playing the same game everyone else is playing.\n\nInstead find a way to get into direct contact with the decision maker of the hiring (usually hiring manager) and demonstrate your value, how you can solve their problems (making widgets, selling widgets or increasing performance of the former or latter). \n\nThis can be sending a cold email to the person introducing yourself and providing some value which requires diligence, research and work [3].\n\ne.g., \nHi Hiring Manager XYZ,\n\nI noticed you're hiring for position Account Executive, based on some analysis of your competitor ABC's products, I think DEF has the superior QRT because H, J, and K reasons.\n\nI was curious so I did some poking around and had some ideas of potential prospects that might generate some deals moving forward:\n\n1. Name at Company A - Title\n2. Name at Company B - Title\n3. Name at Company C - Title\n\nI think #3 has decision making authority and Company C has recently raised its Series B round and is in need of &lt;DEF product&gt;.\n\nAny interest in getting on a call to discuss?\n\nMy cell: ...; or feel free to send me a Calendly link.\n\nI'm not an expert but maybe that gives some food for thought.\n\n---\n\n[1] The problem with your approach thus far, at least as I read it, is your taking the \"spread fire shot approach\" - this can work if it's in your free time, but if you're burning real cash -- you have to focus on the *problems* you want to solve for other people instead of random widgets and gadgets. Businesses exist to help people solve their problems (See \"Jobs to Be Done Theory\") - most of the time at your age, you just don't have enough real world experience to know what a mid-level manager at a technology company (who is your product's prospect) needs and struggles with, instead you spin your wheels building B2C products (really hard). \n[2] Robert Kiyosaki's path to becoming a business owner and investor was this way too. \n[3] Sales today is not the same as 20 years ago, it's not the sleazy car salesman instead it's taking the role of a trusted advisor - see Dale Carnegie's Sell!",

If you like computer repairs, perhaps getting into an electrician trade school might be a good option? \nTLDR: I have the same head as you where I lose sleep at times overthinking everything I could be doing to make more money. I was dead broke (in CC debt) working in restaurants until about 24/25, then Covid hit and I applied to every job possible and ended up in finance (finance/econ major in college). I now make 6 figures, married, own a home, but still ask a lot of what if’s. I was always creative and think I would have killed it if I just followed my creative passions, but alcohol in the restaurant industry got in the way and I pursued booze, herb, and women. Thankfully I’m doing well now, but like I said, I still look back and forward, constantly thinking what more I can do with my skills and interests. \nCurrently exploring no-code app building but it does require $ investments.. the less technical you are the more expensive it is too, and I am not very technical and don’t have time to learn that shit with a full time job, a wife, home and a kid on the way. So here I am. \nAnyway, if you ever wanna talk ideas, strategy, etc, from someone who has failed and picked themselves back up but still yearns for more, let me know. Best of luck!",

This is the problem I've seen time and time again, Honestly it's very similar to people wanting \"romantic love\". **We often idealize what finding the right person is, or finding the right business or venture**. The reality is that every venture or \"vehicle\" can work, why? Because right now there's someone pursuing that venture and succeeding. You've mentioned many ventures you pursued, and I imagine you've gone to a point where you've hit the wall of frustration, or the valley of despair, Where you realize said venture isn't what it was cracked up to be. the funny thing is every single venture has bottlenecks, trade offs, And limitations you need to solve for. (But every time you jump ship, you're starting over!) Knowing all I know about psychology and reward systems, I think what you really want is \"A venture that yields a reward fast enough To make me feel Like **I've got it, this is the one**\" and if you get a small win early on, Then that often pushes you to want to keep pursuing said task, goal or venture. This is why it's so helpful to account for your skill set. And pick a venture that has the most crossover to utilize said skill set, **so you're not starting over from zero**! Trust me brother I know it's a struggle, **BUT** it become significantly less of a struggle, when you pick a path/ venture, Burn the boats, And commit to sinking four to five years of your life into it. At the end of that road you'll at the very least have a monstrous skill set to show for it. And in turn you just keep **getting better**! and if you just keep getting better, eventually \"better\" will yield something. Good luck my friend!",

          "body": "Bro I’m 24 about to be 25 next year , I was in your position a few years ago, my boy when I tell you I tried everything for online money I did, during Covid I got recruited for those academy’s that claimed to teach you about trading , crypto, but it was lowkey a pyramid scheme cuz they kept pushing you to recruit instead, I was a hungry 20 year old trying to learn the skill set of trading I didn’t care about nothing else, thru out my time in there I asked the right questions to the right people and invested into a couple of mentors , I say a couple bc I decided to go my own route and do things my own way, I learned the forex market but didn’t like how I’d have to be up at 3am est for London session to open bc that’s where the volatility kicks in, ima be honest , after 1.5 years of studying , investing into crypto , actually scaling a couple hundreds to thousands I felt like I knew it all but little did I know that was just mere luck and that I didn’t know jack sh*t in the markets , fast forward, I took a break from it and built myself in the gym ( I’ve been overweight my whole life and even my family would say that’s just “my body is built” I said bs , so I worked and trained hard and transformed my body built myself gain so much confidence, and got in a comfortable relationship to where I was ready to close my chapter of learning the markets , well the  relationship ended and I felt like I needed to get back to my main path in life that I was making for myself and that was the trading markets , loosing money constantly trying to make it workout now that I look back at it I could of saved myself a couple hundreds if I’d stuck with 1 mentor who really did what they said they’d do , but that wasn’t my case I wanted to do it the “free way” but let’s be real , learning a skill set that’s a high income and 90% of people telling you it’s impossible to learn your bound to lose a couple $$$ to potentially make all that back in a month , a year ago today I locked in again , instead of forex I switch to futures like the nasdaq &amp; sp500 , Gold, keep in mind I was hungry to learn so those previous years I fr starred at the charts all day so I had someone an idea what I was doing already. Met a mentor on TikTok joined his discord met people just like me hungry to make it out , some bs happened with the mentor that me and some of the students in there decided to leave and make our own free discord and brought some people with us, we all been in this journey now for a year , one of the homies now he’s 24 just like me closed a $30k trade off gold that took him like 1 hr to make another friend of ours , she’s a mom lol , but her dedication to learn this is as much as all of us last week aswell she made $12k off a trade aswell , including myself , after a year of locking back in I finally broke the cycle and everything clicked I took my first ever payout of $1,800 off a prop firm called topstep , my birthday is in may and I’m on a mission to have $25k in Cash by then , I tell you this bc I can tell your hungry for more and if you are up for the late night , studying , starring at candle sticks , learn to trade , yes 90% of people fail but that’s bc they don’t have fully control of there emotion / psychology, and that’s #1 before you see any results \n\nIf you up for the challenge and want it as bad as you want to breathe here’s a good start , on YT search up “tjr bootcamp” \n\nYou may see that people talk sh*t about this guy but he’s 23 with a freaking koenigsegg AT23!!! If your bashing on him that just speaks about yourself and your mindset bc some people just hate on him while others like me see it as motivation to get out of this rat race, \n\nAnyways , his boot camps videos are beginner friendly and i recommend him to almost anyone who has no clue about trading. \nIt’s not impossible, you just got to want it as bad as you want to breathe , Goodluck if you do decide to take this path , don’t tell anyone not even your parents or closest friend that you want to trade bc off the rip they’ll tell you “ it’s gambling” but as a someone who’s spent every dollar on this combines accounts to pass and get funded  so I can actually make money and finally seeing my growth , I’m telling you F**k what anyone else thinks, you’re young rn your able to take more risk compared to a 30 year old \n\nI tell you this bc in our homie discord we got people that are 19 , 20 , 21 all of us starting to print money and we can see the change happening in front of our eyes , but I promise you this , every single person making money in trading has gone thru hell learning this skill set IT IS NOT EASY BUT IT SURELY ISNT IMPOSSIBLE",

Perfect for staying focused while it does the boring stuff.\n* Frizerly: Helps us automate SEO and blogs using AI. The tool learns about your business and can auto-publish blogs directly on your website daily using Google data to improve search rankings!\n* ChatPRD: For PMs who hate writing PRDs from scratch. This tool auto-generates specs, syncs with Linear, and helps teams stay aligned on product vision.\n* Superhuman: Still the gold standard for email productivity. If you’ve never tried it, this might be the fastest way to reclaim four hours of your week.\n* ChatGPT: Super obvious, but helps with brainstorming, summarizing reports etc.\n* Cursor: Helps both me and my team write code much faster.

This is not a promotional comment, rather I am a builder trying to validate a genuine idea that I believe could help some of the founders out there. I am building an AI tool, basically an AI accountability partner. The most failure stories of founders and builders that I have heard about is getting initial validation and then the product failing in the market. So I thought of building an anti-empathetic AI tool that will ask critical questions at your decisions and reminds you brutally about the goals you set and how much you achieve. I am thinking of using multi AI agents orchestrations to swarm a group of personal advisory AI agents to do the work and this might cost a bit more than usual chatbots like AI, so I have to validate this idea and I think this is the best place to make that validation.\n\nSo founders, what do you think?",

However, a series of apps to address things have been integrated in the prior two.  The trouble with initial technology innovation is the average employee now works with 10 apps, never mind moving between them.\n\nNow, I suggest a primary stack with a lot things apps integrated usually described as a revenue operating system (RevOps). That said get a RevOps with a human centric AI to automate so many things in different roles.  For example, today's average salesperson spends 30% of their time selling.  The other things they do are not productive, revenue generating, and really not their job.  So align an AI to a sales person to handle meeting notes, if on the road record what happened during the trip, produce account and monthly sales reports, and more. The sales roles is one example, the same premise can be used for many other roles.  So instead laying off everybody, optimize your #1 asset or people with AI enable RevOps (reducing 10 apps a day to one central stack).",

Not some get-rich-quick thing but like... actual recurring revenue.\n\nBasically I built a voice bot that answers phones for dental offices using ElevenLabs and n8n. Sounds boring but hear me out.\n\nThe whole idea came from my dentist's office constantly missing calls when they're busy. I was like... why isn't this automated yet? So I just built it.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAnswers calls 24/7, books appointments, answers the basic stuff like office hours and insurance questions, and passes the complicated calls to real people. That's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nStack is super simple - ElevenLabs API for the voice (seriously their voices are insanely good now), n8n to connect everything together, and it hooks into their calendar system.\n\nWhat actually worked\n\nStarted with literally one clinic. Didn't even charge them much at first, just wanted to see if it actually worked in the real world. Spent like a full day just sitting at their front desk watching what they do.\n\nThe voice thing is weirdly important. My first version sounded like a corporate robot and people hated it. Made it sound more friendly and casual and suddenly everyone was fine with it.\n\nYou HAVE to let people bail to a human. I added a \"press 0 anytime\" thing and it made all the difference. Some people just aren't gonna talk to a bot and that's cool.\n\nHonestly the biggest lesson was don't try to make it do everything. It handles the boring repetitive calls and that's enough. The staff handles the rest.\n\nWhere I'm at now\n\nStarted in August with that one clinic, now I've got 4. Charging like $500-800 to set it up then $200-400 a month depending on call volume. Making around $1400/month right now which isn't crazy but it's growing.\n\nBest moment was when one of the office managers told me her team can actually eat lunch now without stressing about phones. Made the whole thing feel worth it honestly.\n\nNot gonna lie my first launch was a disaster lmao. It double booked a bunch of appointments because I messed up the calendar integration. But you figure it out.\n\nIf you wanna try this\n\nJust find one local business with a phone problem. Dentists, hair salons, lawyers, whatever. Build something simple that solves ONE annoying thing they deal with every day.\n\nDon't overthink it. My whole setup runs on like $50/month in costs and took me maybe 2 weeks to build the first version.\n\nAnyway hope this helps someone. Happy to answer stuff if you have questions\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all nice comments and ton of upvotes i really appreciate it.",

The fact that you started by watching the front desk in person says it all; building something useful always starts with empathy, not tech hype.\n\nRespect for keeping it simple and focusing on fit, not perfection. That “press 0 for a human” move is classic shows you actually get user needs instead of forcing full automation. The pricing and rollout are solid too. This is how actual businesses get built with AI, not just by chasing trendy prompts.\n\nAppreciate you sharing the “messy launch” failures, too. That’s what most people never admit. Rooting for your growth, would love to hear more about which features matter most as you get more clinics (and how you keep things smooth as volume grows)!",

They spend months building cool shit that nobody ever finds out about because their marketing is an afterthought.\n\nYour copy advice is solid too. Trying to appeal to everyone means you're generic as hell and nobody connects with it. Pick a specific person with a specific problem and talk directly to them.\n\nThe other big one is most businesses discover their marketing isn't working way too late. They run campaigns for months assuming people are seeing their stuff, then find out their emails were landing in spam the whole time or their ads were targeting the wrong audience. By the time they figure it out, they've burned through their budget.\n\nMarketing isn't just about having good copy or a clear target audience, it's about making damn sure your message actually reaches people. Doesn't matter how perfect your targeting is if your emails go to spam or your ads never get approved.\n\nFocus on distribution first, product second.

I'm an online coach specializing in fitness and nutrition, and I take online clients from over the country.\n\nI actually use AI to make graphics and templates for social media posts, and templates for digital products that I can sell on online stores like journals, trackers, calendars, etc. I use AI to make an organized template which is the skeleton for it, then fill in as I need, it's excellent for saving time and funds.\n\nI also am using it to implement client outreach and acquisition, I'm looking into applications I can use to find leads that I can actually reach out to.\n\nThere are already a thousand ways to make money, AI is another tool that's available to us to make our processes easier, just like heavy equipment machines for construction, and design software for engineers and technicians.",

When I am heading to the meeting I usually know what I am responsible for and what is important. I usually use the title and description of the meeting on teams to prepare and write a short punch list of what I need from it and what I need to execute. Then if the meeting goes past the allotted time I excuse myself saying \"I think I have what I need from this meeting can I be excused? I really have some important objectives to achieve in the next hour.\" I usually do not get pushback from setting boundaries. Meetings usually have a set time allotment and I try not to go past that time period. If it is completely off track I write down important questions for that department before I leave and send a clarification email after leaving. The whole point of meetings is to relay information. If the person who is in charge does not relay information in an efficient manner it is not your fault and your work is just as important as everyone else's. So set meeting boundaries and make sure you get what you need while you are there. Never leave before the time allotment and only engage in longer than anticipated meetings if your superior or his superior is present. Excuse yourself in any meeting you can as soon as the time has run over. If you can delegate tasks to AI or someone competent and close and have them send you detailed notes to review at your convenience. Your time is money 🤑 the less you have the freedom to use it the lower your income. If you are the boss then delegation should be top priority by choosing capable reports to handle 90% of the busy work. 5% of the people handle payroll, accounting, and I'm invoicing. The last 5% is yours to plan at your leisure.",

How much is your time worth, and could it be better spent on sales or strategy instead of playing catch-up on notes? \n\nThe big question to ask is: **how much time are you currently wasting on workarounds?** Your scattered notes are a workaround. When you realize the cost of your time trying to fix these issues (and the risk of forgetting a commitment) is more than the cost of a new tool, it's time to upgrade.\n\nBefore you look at any new tool, it helps to identify the specific problem you're trying to solve.

Entrepreneurship isn't taking control, it is giving up more of it, especially when you're first getting started.\n\nYou cease answering to a boss and begin answering to staff, contractors, investors, clients, tax men, bankers, vendors, and more.\n\nHaving a single person to answer to is a luxury people fail to see until they're drowning.\n\n&gt;7 hours of meetings yesterday. Then spent hours trying to remember what was decided in each one. \\[...\\] The worst part? Keeping track of it all. Who said what, when things are due, which client needs what follow-up. I'm constantly scrambling through scattered notes trying to piece together what was actually agreed upon.\n\nProject managers, especially those who are experts in specialized methods like Scrum or Canban, etc, are paid a lot of money to teach teams systems of managing projects. Bosses are project managers. You need to learn how to manage your tasks, commitments, and duties and prioritize, triage, and complete them.\n\nDo you know 4 out of 5 small businesses fail in 5 years? Because their owners think they can fire a boss and do the same thing with less stress. Nope, you now are the boss, and everything you took for granted at the place you once worked is now on you... project management, sales, bookkeeping, hr, and more.\n\nYou can fix this. See below.\n\n&gt;Everything is \"urgent\" and \"quick 15-minute chats\" turn into hour-long requirement sessions.\n\nWelcome to an important thing called: setting boundaries. Plan 30 or 60 minute chats, and keep you and your fellow meeting person on task. If someone says \"I have a 15-minute quick question\", and it isn't, talk to them about ways they can better prepare themselves and you so you do not overrun the schedule. Require follow-ups if you can't finish, but also, teach the people you work with that your time is valuable and brevity and directness is mandatory and respectful.\n\n&gt;I'm drowning in administrative overhead and playing catch-up on commitments I made in meetings I can barely remember.\n\nThis isn't a symptom of too many meetings, this is a symptom of a lack of a lack of organization and lack of knowledge how to get organized. Not to be harsh, but this is a you problem not an entrepreneurship problem. That said, welcome to the biz.\n\nYou can learn what you need to know.\n\nTake notes. Create to-do items from meetings. Use productivity tools to keep track of items. Use Canban or Scrum methods to track items. Task management apps can be formatted toward those techniques. Create summaries you can easily access every start of work day. \n\nIf you can't keep track of choices you and your team make, you're not ready to do this thing you're doing.\n\nPerhaps put a one-week pause on new meetings and focus on learning a system to stay organized.",

Make sure to start closing down the meeting 5 minutes before your leaving time, then get up and leave when time is up. Your time is precious and people need to get to the point fast if they want some of your time.\n\n2. Carry an A4 Spiral note pad with you to every meeting. Make any notes you like, but for every action you need to do, put a square box in the margin beside it. For every action someone else needs to do, put a round circle in the margin beside it. This makes it really easy to find the actions and you can tick the boxes and circles when they are done.",

          "body": "Agree with everything OP says. In addition, the hardest truth I learnt is that the feeling of not being good enough never really goes away. You always learn more every day, realise you didn't think of something and have to learn yet another thing from scratch. You start questioning whether you really know anything at all. That feeling paralyses you from doing the learning, being productive and you end up procrastinating because you're overwhelmed. It's important to accept that this feeling won't end.\n\nThe other hard truth I learnt is that without your health, there is no business. I used to be really proud of my lifestyle. Woke up at 5, went to the gym, and ate well and was in incredible shape and was very organised, disciplined, and productive. After being a founder, I feel like I've lost control of everything. I felt guilty for spending time looking after myself and resting. I felt like I should always be working and stopped going gym, ate whatever, slept at random times and tried to work continuously. I've slowly and finally accepted that you need to take days off to rest, eat, and sleep properly. Otherwise, you will burn out fast, and end up being unproductive and inconsistent.\n\nHandling the emotional roller coaster is a beast, but what helped me is talking to other founders and someone who can hold you accountable. I started telling some of the people I see at the gym that I will be there on this day. They're expecting me so I turn up. Same with anything you have been procrastinating on, set a deadline and get someone to hold you accountable. It does work for the short term when you are struggling, and you get stuff done so you don't look stupid. Eventually, you gain control of it yourself and form the discipline necessary. \n\nI've also found that not getting excited regardless of what is happening, whether that is good or bad, keeps me in a balanced emotional state to make sound business decisions. I hope you are doing okay, and it will pay off. Believe in yourself and your dreams.",

And honestly, I don’t blame them.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s all about what makes you happy. There’s no single right path we all have different goals and definitions of success. Unfortunately, social media makes entrepreneurship look like a walk in the park, usually from people who’ve never really done it themselves.",

Survivorship bias: we all hear about the beauty of building a startup, but we only hear from those who have succeeded. We very rarely, if ever, hear from the hundreds who have failed. That said, if you were to believe that 95% of startups fail, that means for every successful entrepreneur we hear from, there are 19 others who never got to share their story and have faded into obscurity.\n\n2. The bias of overconfidence. Think of this like the dunning kruger effect: the less you know about something, the more confident you feel about it. Entrepreneurship is no different in this respect. When we choose this life, very few of us are fully aware of what we are signing up for.\n\n3. The planning fallacy, which Daniel Kahneman talks about beautifully. Basically, whenever we make plans, most of us have a horrible habit of being overly optimistic and systematically underestimating the time, costs, and risks of future actions while overestimating the benefits. \n\nAll that being said, I can also say that if you stick with it, entrepreneurship can be one of the most rewarding things you can do with your time, and I can not imagine myself doing anything else.",

And that's not a failure, that's just reality. Your brain isn't built to focus on ten things equally, and the moment you try to, you end up doing a mediocre job at all of them instead of a great job at a few.\n\nSo here's what's helped me when I was drowning like you are right now:\n\n**First, stop trying to do everything equally.** Instead, figure out what absolutely cannot wait this week, and what can sit in the background for a bit. University work and your cousin's startup probably have deadlines. Your personal projects? They can wait a week or two without the world ending. Same with staying visible online. It's better to post one banger piece of content when you have the mental space than force out mediocre stuff daily just to \"stay consistent.\"\n\n**Second, accept that some things will slip.** You mentioned that when you focus on one thing, five others start falling apart. Yeah, that's gonna happen. But here's the secret: those five things aren't actually falling apart forever. They're just on pause. You'll come back to them. The key is knowing the difference between \"pausing\" and \"quitting.\" You're not quitting, you're just prioritizing.\n\n**Third, rejections suck. Period.** They make you question everything. But here's what I learned after getting rejected from like a hundred things: rejection doesn't mean you're going in the wrong direction. It just means that particular path wasn't it. You're still moving forward, you're still learning, you're still building. Some of my biggest wins came right after my worst rejections because I used that anger and disappointment as fuel to go even harder.",

Hell, I’m still living parts of it.\n\nI’m a developer with about 58+ projects in various states of “almost done.” I’d get things to 80-90% complete, get excited about the next idea, and jump ship. Rinse and repeat for years. The problem wasn’t motivation or even discipline - it was that I genuinely wanted to do ALL of it.\nHere’s what’s actually helping me (I’m not going to pretend I’ve figured it all out, but I’m further than I’ve ever been)\n\nThe 70/30 Rule\n\nI picked ONE primary project to actually finish. 70% of my work time goes there, no exceptions. The other 30%? That’s my creative relief valve. I work on whatever excites me that day. This keeps me from feeling creatively suffocated while still making real progress on the thing that matters.\n\nNoting vs. Acting\n\nThis one changed everything. When I get an idea during work time, I note it down and keep working. I don’t act on it. Sounds simple, but it’s hard as hell when you’re someone who gets excited about new things. The idea gets captured, I don’t lose it, but I also don’t derail my day.\n\nExternal Accountability\n\nYou mentioned not having friends to talk through this with - I get that. I use an AI coach (Claude, actually) for structured weekly check-ins. Sunday planning, mid-week pulse check, Saturday review. Having something outside my own head that tracks whether I’m actually doing what I said I would has been huge.\n\nTiny, Specific Tasks\n\nNot “work on project.” But “spend 2 hours fixing the login bug” or “write product description.” Small enough that I can’t hide from them. Specific enough that I know when they’re done. I use iPhone Reminders because complex systems just add friction.\n\nAccepting the Pattern\n\nI’ve had to get brutally honest about my pattern: I build things, get them almost done, then find reasons not to launch (usually “just one more feature”). Knowing this doesn’t make it go away, but it helps me catch it. When I start finding “one more thing,” I can ask myself: is this actually needed, or am I scared to ship?\nHere’s something I’m learning: finishing ONE thing imperfectly is worth more than building ten things to 80%. The confidence from actually shipping something real changes how you see yourself.\n\nI’m not where I want to be yet. But I’m closer than I’ve ever been because I stopped trying to hold everything and started finishing one thing. The rest can wait.",

On the side , i was recently working with a founder on a saas for publishers , i had connected with her on YCombinator cofounder site . So we never had things on contract, but rather like it was discussed that we will work and figure out things for an exploratory period like 3 months , and then see how it pans out.   \n  \nWe ended up creating a MVP much recently. And I started gathering feedback for the same, me being the person who is working on product and tech side. So i outreached people on reddit and outreached publishers through google. And i ended up  outreaching a publisher who herself had created a software around accounting for publishers.   \n  \nSo she mailed us to figure out collaboration since she was focusing more on core publishing and thought that our  company could take better care of the product . So i shared that mail with my founder and i was happy at that time. I thought B2B partnership might be very beneficial. And i suggested her , maybe not collaboration but maybe we can have this person as advisor. To have a conversation to figure how can this pan out. \n\nSo she mentioned to wait before responding, and I went back to resolving a bug or something. An hour later, my access to github is gone, vercel is gone and i get an email that i am fired effective immediately. And i was just shocked and didn't know how to react to this. She just mentioned that she is firing me , and no call or anything. Apparently on her end she started thinking that i have been collaborating and sharing code to other companies or this publisher . And i tried to explain her that this is a misunderstanding and if she would have reached out that publisher. She would have understood the same. Naturally i am not ever working there.   \n  \nI am very sad, for starters. And I thought that the core agreements could have been done later, however the important thing was validation of the product. And i worked on this as my own product , and i believed it the same as well. But the fact that i just got fired over an email without any conversation made me realised how little my founder would have thought possibly just a freelancer. \n\nSo i wanted to understand what things did i do wrong ? Should everything be on paper. Should i keep my holding company moving forward ??   \nAnd what should i do for the next thing or partnership , since i can't really do everything on my own. ",

The learning here for the next time is, firstly, always write an agreed deal down, preferably on paper + signature, but exchange of emails can work and, secondly, only transfer IP in your deliverables when either paid or equity allocated. For this situation, look at the contract signed &amp; esp the termination clause. Can she terminate effective immediately? That would be unusual. What happens if she breaches the contract, which she has done if she didn't follow the termination clause, &amp; esp does that affect the IP transfer in your deliverables - the essential question is does the IP transfer if she breaches the contract. It shouldn't &amp; would need some orecise language to all breach not affecting the IP transfer. Get a US lawyer to give a quote to review - I'd say an hour or two is all someone decent needs for a review &amp; either email advice or verbal advice. Then a letter putting her on notice of her breach can be sent. The question for you is do you have some money to spend &amp; what is the likely result her - some equity or cash?

      "selftext": "Just did an audit of our software spending because our burn rate seemed way too high\n\n  \nIt turns out that we're paying for 5 separate subscriptions to Notion across 3 different credit cards. Some are individual plans, some are team plans and one is an enterprise plan that nobody is even using\n\n  \nHow does this happen? I'll tell you how it happens. It's because different teams just sign up for shit without even CHECKING if we already have it. Marketing has their own. Engs have their own. Sales has their own. Even our 2 person HR team has their own workspace\n\n  \nI added it all up and we're spending like $900 per month on Notion when we could have one enterprise plan for close to 500\n\n  \nAnd it's not just Notion btw. We have multiple Zoom accounts, 3 different Figma subscriptions, 4 ChatGPT plus accounts (why???) amd 2 AWS accounts that are both being used for different projects\n\n  \nI brought this up to our COO and he just shrugged and said that that's what happens when you grow fast what an answer hahahaha",

I'll take a wild swing and say you don't have one, that's why this happens. The cost for this goes far beyond extra subscription costs, it'll eat away at organizational efficacy and eventually when you want to re-align technologies it'll be a major hassle. The \"grow fast\" excuse is just that, what he really means is \"grow revenue at the expense of...\" which is when execs put revenue targets above everything else.

A first generation immigrant restaurant worker building up a nest egg and using it to open their own place is one of the only paths to prosperity available to someone with a high school education in a foreign language.  And subsequently many of their kids follow this path.  \n\nThe other side of the coin are multi-millionaires with loads of confirmation bias about their abilities due to years of selling annuities to rubes or sitting on a boring family business like an established CPA practice.  They set their kids or wife up with a passion project in a high dollar corporate lease and all the sudden they owe $8k a month for 6 years on a personal guarantee.  Their nepos burn out in 9 months and go back to just existing or maybe limp along for a handful of years. Sometimes this consumes the legacy business as well and tanks the whole family.  Either way it ends up with the usual business for sale listing quoting 4 years of best case scenario revenue as a lump sum pay out. That sits for a year before they offer the place up for raw parts and assumption of the lease.  \n\nSource: former broke ass restaurant worker, former broke ass restaurant owner, former consultant, and current financial advisor.  I've seen it from both sides top to bottom.  I'll be telling my kids to stay in school until a W2 can solve their problems.",

It was chaotic because they were chatty and I had to herd them and look out for stragglers. I wasn't used to such a large group. I had 16 complete the tour. The whole day had been stressful so I was distracted and forgot to make sure the first person paid me for the extra 4 people before ending the tour last night. Today I'm texting her for the extra tickets and so far she's not answering. Hoping she will eventually, but what can I do if she doesn't? That's $140.

          "body": "Yeah, moving forward, if they want to add to the tour, your new rule is that payment for added participants after the first booking must be received 48 hours in advance of the tour. \n\nHave a number in mind that you prefer to entertain. That number is a bit lower than what you are able to entertain. Now you are realizing that 16 people is a lot. Moving forward, do not go over the usual 12 people, but if a group asks in advance “hey is there any way it could be 14 or 15?” your answer is yes, but you require payment for them 48 hours in advance, otherwise they will be asked to leave at the time of the tour. They should know this, because now it’s in a contract that they sign. \n\nNow let’s say that someone *doesn’t ask* because of course, that’s going to happen. Either the extra participants are not allowed to participate, or, they have to pay a $10 convenience/last minute fee on top of the ticket fee. The booker shouldn’t gawk at this, because they will have signed a contract upon payment that says “I understand that any added participants must be agreed upon with the tour guide and paid in full at least 48 hours in advance of the tour. Failure to communicate and pay for them in advance will result in those participants to be turned away from the tour unless the extra participants pay for their ticket plus a $10 convenience fee before the tour starts.” \n\n\nIf you don’t have a contract that they sign, get one. I believe that you have some legal precedent to have her pay if you both agreed in writing, but to be honest, I would just cut the loss if she never responds and use this money to make a contract if you don’t have one that includes contingencies and policies like this.",

One of our founding clients has approached us about going exclusive - they want us to dissolve our agency and work only for them as their dedicated in-house marketing team.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- 17 clients generating solid revenue ($48K per month) \n\n- 9-person team (2 partners + 7 staff)\n\n- Client proposing exclusive deal has been with us since Year 1 (currently paying $9500/mo) \n\n- They've grown significantly with us (but only getting ~15-20% of our bandwidth currently)\n\n- They're our largest single client but represent &lt;20% of our revenue \n\n**The Proposal:**\n- 12-month exclusive contract\n- We'd reduce from 9 to 4 people (me, business partner, 2 key team members)\n- Compensation: Base monthly retainer + 10% commission on their course/digital product sales\n- Scope: Personal brand, company brand, course business, potential support for spouse's brand\n- We'd be walking away from 80%+ of our current revenue to take this\n\n**The Numbers Being Discussed:**\n- $379K for the 4 person team ($144k yearly salary  for me and my partner each) \n- Commission could add $10-50K+ if we scale their course business\n- This would roughly match our current personal income but with commission upside (currently making $7k a month + building cash reserve for agency) \n- We'd go from managing 17 clients to 100% focus on one brand ecosystem\n\n**What We're Torn On:**\n\nPros:\n- Simplified operations (1 client vs 17)\n- Higher personal income potential with commission structure\n- Deep partnership with someone we've proven success with\n- 12-month contract = stability\n- Elimination of constant sales/client management\n- Can build elite expertise in one vertical\n\n**Cons:**\n- 100% concentration risk\n- Walking away from $460K+ annual revenue from other clients\n- Pausing agency growth trajectory (we could hit $1M+ in 3-5 years)\n- If it fails, we rebuild from zero\n- Letting go of 5 team members\n- No diversification\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. **Has anyone made a similar pivot?** How did it turn out?\n\n2. **Is $30-32K/month + 10% commission fair** for dissolving a multi-client agency and going exclusive? Or are we undervaluing ourselves?\n\n3. **Red flags we should watch for?** Client has been great for 2 years, but exclusive relationships can change dynamics.\n\n4. **Contract terms we absolutely need?** We're thinking 12-month minimum, quarterly advance payments, 90-day notice. What are we missing?\n\n5. **How do you value opportunity cost?** Is the simplified life worth the concentration risk?\n\n6. **Anyone regret going exclusive?** What would you do differently?\n\n**Additional Context:**\n- Client is ready to scale (proven product-market fit with their course)\n- They have budget and seem committed\n- We'd still own our systems/processes\n- Could theoretically rebuild agency if this ends\n\n**The Real Question:**\nAre we crazy for even considering this? Or is this the kind of focused partnership that could be more valuable than spreading ourselves thin across 17 clients?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's faced a similar decision - especially if you've been on either side of an exclusive arrangement.\n\n**Edit:** To clarify - we're not desperate or struggling. Agency is healthy and growing. This is purely a strategic decision about depth vs. breadth.",

The security is an illusion. You go from being an independent business owner to an employee so you lose your freedom and mobility. No doubt the contract will protect him more than it protects you. And the final nail in the coffin is that you lose your ability to truly scale. \n\nInstead, counter him. Tell him you will provide an exclusive team that will operate under contract with his business and they will have no other accounts. That team of 4 will be under a noncompete with you for 5-10 years so none of them get the same offer you got and strike out on their own with this client as their first. You will also still take the retainer to lead this team independently of the remainder of your business, and the salary should be paid to your company to then be distributed to the employees based on their contract with you.\n\nDon’t destroy what you built for the illusion of safety and predictability.

Things have a tendency to change and not for the better when the dynamic shifts.\n\nIf they were to go out and assemble an in house team, how much time and money would it cost them before they were successful?  I imagine it'd be at least $500k and a year+ before they got this all dialed in.\n\nInstead, they want to buy a pre-assembled team.\n\nDid you come this far to only come this far?\n\nA 12 month employment contract doesn't offer any long term upside.  What if they decide to fire you (and/or your partner) and hire someone cheaper in a year?  Does what you personally bring to the operation actually command a $144k salary in the open market?  If not, why would they keep you around?\n\nOnce you've closed your agency and given away your best talent to this company, what do they still need you for?\n\nIf they were offering you and your partner $200k each up front and a 3-5 year employment contract, that might be a different conversation.  But I don't see anything like that here. \n\nAs stated, you're getting the short end of the deal with no protection.",

The biggest issue is you are giving up a stable situation with a lot of long-term upside for a position that only has a short-term guarantee and that introduces a lot of risk.  \n\nI would encourage you to consider the exclusive deal as something more like an acquisition.  If they were buying your company, they would have to pay you the value of the current business, and/or in some combination give you a job at a guaranteed rate for some length of time, plus some earn-out and/or success-based compensation.  This is something like what they are proposing, except the guarantee isn't very long, and even if you max out the commission, it doesn't seem like they are paying you enough to throw away the rest of your business.  They would also have to be paying you enough to walk away from the future growth of that business -- just as in an acquisition, except you might not be looking to sell if you still have a lot of value-maximization to do in growing the company.  It's hard to imagine them ever wanting to pay enough for a 1-year deal with you to balance all that out, but if you want to exit to them and can get them to pay for the terminal value of the business, maybe it's a conversation.\n\nIt's also unclear what is motivating them to do this.  Are they not getting enough resources from you?  Get a larger guarantee from them and scale up the team serving them.  Give them some kind of preferred rate and priority SLA in exchange for it, and make sure X% of your personal time is focused on that business.  Spend the rest of your time and/or find other folks to keep growing the business that is not with this client.",

If you want to sell your soul and work for the man again, then consider the deal. Otherwise take the solid advice laid out here by others and set this account up with a curated team. Make sure the contract has a no solicitation clause for your top talent who will work the account and that your margins are set at a high enough level (higher than now) to compensate you for the loss of these team members on your other accounts. After all, you are incurring an opportunity cost by taking them out of service to others. Also consider emphasizing to the client that they do currently benefit from the fact that you are actively working in the same and perhaps other industries that will keep your content cutting edge sharp. If they insist on bringing it in house and they are a big enough growth partner, offer to help them set it up, find a few employees and provide 100 percent cooperation with their internal team.  Then, stay involved in the account growth… the new internal team does the simple stuff to save them some $ and give them the speed to market or whatever controls they are craving and you do the amazing, impactful, big idea work. Set up a mutual progress meeting quarterly. If they want exclusivity within their specific industry, no problem, but that costs more (unless this is not an issue for you) Good luck and remember, being your own bosses is why you are here!!

I like to do this personally to make sure everything is clear and to answer any questions.\n\nI also explained that he would receive a second email where he would need to sign the waiver and other documents. After that, the rental insurance page would appear, clearly marked as optional, and he could choose to decline it.\n\nHe became irritated and said I was not being transparent and that he did not appreciate it. I explained that the insurance is completely optional and that we only offer it because other customers have requested it. It is even mentioned at the beginning of the confirmation email.\n\nHe told me I had ruined his fun and said he felt obligated to buy insurance. I repeated that he did not have to purchase it, but he said, “Well, now I am worried something might happen during my trip,” and then he hung up.\n\nI am honestly confused about how I was not being transparent.

          "body": "This is the customer's problem for the most part, so no harm done...but if you're noticing a lot of people are dropping off at the insurance page, then you might want to think about testing some alternative routes to booking completion.\n\nNote, I'm not saying you've done anything wrong at all here, just that you could potentially convert those people who are upsell / add-on averse like what happened here to potentially another successful rental.\n\nThe problem is, people see that second page and think \"why are they trying to sell me insurance now? If I needed it, why isn't it included?\" They might even go so far as to start thinking along the lines of \"this is how they get you\" - and a that would be both ends of that scale - \"they sell you insurance you don't need!\" AND \"they'll screw you for any damage at the other end, and tell you that you should have bought the insurance!!\". Obviously neither are true, but people - bloody hell.\n\nInstead of making the insurance optional in an additional step, try showing both options on the same page - still making it super clear one is WITH accidental damage insurance, and one WITHOUT. Maybe add some wording that the expectation is they bring their own insurance or take the risk, on their wallet be it.\n\nMaybe even try just one price - with insurance included as standard - and having the option to REMOVE it, instead of add it. You just need to be careful about how you can advertise your pricing then, so you don't price yourself out of the market against competitors who don't include insurance.\n\nThe reason these kinds of approaches can work? You're making them feel more in control - making their own choices, kind of thing. It's not an upsell when the options are all presented the same page, it's an informed choice.\n\nDo note however that sometimes, the smallest changes can have the biggest impacts, but good AND bad...so whenever you're testing things like this, be ready to be analysing your numbers as close to realtime as you can - have solid baseline figures recorded so you're not just going off 'feel' (though that is also important), and change or revert these changes if they're showing a negative impact.",

      "selftext": "UPDATE:\nI no longer have to worry about the amount of increase coming from UHC by our PEO Insperity. They just notified us they are NOT renewing our group health plan at all! What’s more this includes our Workers Comp Plan (for which I’ve had zero claims for at least 15 years). They said we no longer meet their client “risk tolerance profile”. While I’d love to leave Insperity all together I am now scrambling to find new group health coverage, vision, dental, EPL&amp;I, and Workers Comp. I just don’t know if there is time to change it all. Many suggestions in prior comments are helpful; some aren’t feasible in my particular situation, but all seem to have serious effects on either certain employees, or other issues such as retirement plans, tax issues for both employees and the business, but exploring all the options and figuring this out has now become exponentially more difficult with very little time to do it. I knew they could jack rates into the stratosphere but didn’t know it was possible to get non-renewed!  I’m on it, I’ll figure it out, but normally I wouldn’t have gotten my Insperity renewal contract until after Thanksgiving or early December. Heads up to all small biz owners: do not wait. Reach out proactively in case you are in the same situation as my company. \n\n\nI’m a small business owner of 25 years. I employ 15 people in a professional consultancy business. I’m at a conference today and one owner got his renewal rates for the coming year from Cigna. It’s a 63% increase. He estimates it will cost him $141k more in premiums for his staff this coming year. My company’s increase last year was 17%. I immediately emailed my PEO rep to get me my renewal rates ASAP. I usually get them in late November or early December. We pay the employee portion and employees who want family plans or employee and spouse pay the difference. I’m building my 2026 budget right now. I’m trying to plan raises. I want to increase my 401k match to our staff from 3% to 6%. What are other small business owners seeing in their renewal rates?",

Seeing the cost go up and up and up and up. \n\n\nI only have three people a lot of policy in my insurance went up 16% \n\nBut it goes up pretty much every year and my insurance guy who I think has a pretty good understanding of the industry (and I’m lucky that he takes care of me because there’s not a lot of money in dealing with a small group like mine)\n\n\nHe taught me a lot about healthcare in the role insurance plays in it\n\nNobody cares about the cost of healthcare claims. All they care about is the cost of premium so nobody attributes the cost of claims to what they actually pay. They just would like that cost around differently, which is driven up the costs\n\nThe one thing he taught me that really hit home was Medicare and Medicaid pay much lower reimbursement than typical insurance companies do, and because of the fact they pay reduce rates for claims healthcare providers raise the cost for all of us who aren’t on those programs \n\n\nPeople can blame it on greed or profits but if you go to a university hospital or a nonprofit hospital, you’re paying roughly the same rates as you were at a for-profit hospital \n\n\nBut the bottom line is the fact that cost so much to provide this benefit to our employees… it’s tough\n\nI have a good friend who is executive at a nonprofit and their employees are freaking out because they’re deductible is going up to $1000 rather than 500 … and the employees aren’t paying a penny more for their coverage in premiums a month but the nonprofits gotta pay an additional 11%(keeping the deductible. The same would’ve made it go up something like 19%)\n\nHe told budget to take a look at their financial reports which everyone can look at and ask them where the money is gonna come from… how can they keep the coverage the same without increasing cost to employees?)\n\n\nPeople are legit shocked when they find out that while they pay $100 a month for their individual health insurance that their employers are paying six or 700 \n\nPeople who are fortunate enough to get family coverage and maybe pay for $500 a month think that they’re really getting hosed until they find out their employers are paying 1500 or more on top of the 500 \n\nBut the costs are getting higher and higher because every year the cost of claims goes up and I rarely see people talk about the cost of claims as being something we have to look at\n\nI’m not criticizing you for this you like a lot of people are just frustrated that our cost of doing business or going out, but I don’t think we’re going to see any improvements until people start being honest about what the real challenges has to do with the cost of claims",

My broker said 20%+ and more across the board for small and large groups in my state.\n\nI’m surprised at those who suggesting we jump on the ACA right now. Respectfully, you do know the Fed government is shut down over this issue? I have employees who used that as a great lower cost option in past several years, for their spouse as we pay employee coverage 100%. Now finding out their coverage is not great anymore, as it keeps getting chipped away at, and if subsidies expire they could be paying double soon. Paying out of pocket for spousal coverage on our plan will take a huge chunk of their paycheck. And we pay very competitively in our market.\n\nI do also feel I have a moral obligation to offer my employees excellent healthcare. It’s not right this is our job - I shouldn’t play God &amp; get to decide if you get a PPO or HMO just because you work for me. Once you deep dive on coverage, anything less than a PPO is not worth the money in my opinion. And it’s well known in my area that if you don’t have PPO you’ll have a hard time finding doctors.\n\nClearly folks who think you can get by on catastrophic coverage are young have never had serious or chronic illness. May you forever stay so lucky. I’ve endured stage III cancer, a major accident, and recurring illness and I can rattle on the daily costs of those. It’s not just the immediate cost of care it’s the follow ups, monitoring and specialists. 1 in 3 people will see cancer in their lifetime. And everyone deserves preventative care whether you are 25 or 60. To wait until the worst happens means potentially missing something that could have been caught early, saved the insurance company tens of thousands, saved your employer from losing you in the workforce, and saved you your life.\n\nSorry for the rant, but we should be all very concerned about fixing healthcare. Large business can absorb the increases. But this and other rising costs greatly jeopardize the existence of small business.",

Other than that, I do not know him. \n\nShortly after that interaction, he started advertising that he does \"band instruments rentals\" and offering \"woodwind and brass repair\" - which is what we are focused on. It didn't bother us at all, we do not talk badly of him to anyone. Though many customers have come in and told us some very nasty stories about him - we just say we do not know him and haven't been in his shop. \n\nOver the last year we started getting negative reviews from what appear to be new Google accounts with made up scenarios and stories every other month or so. It is just my husband and I who work here so we really do know every interaction and can back it up with camera footage if need be. \n\nOne review said they took a lesson from us and was treated poorly. At the time of the review, I only had one lesson student, so it was false. After responding to the review that it was fake, the reviewer changed it to, \"called about a repair and no one got back to me\" we checked our voicemail, emails, call log and not a single person had called about repairs that we hadn't replied to. Google will not remove the review. \n\nWe got about 4 more after that and it dropped our 5 star rating to a 4.5, we have gotten a few of them removed, but two won't go away no matter how much reporting. We do reply to all of the reviews and state that what they are saying did not happen and suggest it may have been left for the wrong business. \n\nWe have no proof that it is the other store owner, other than two reviews use the same initials as the guy lol \nEvery single one comes from a google account with 0 other reviews. We have tried to counteract with getting customers to leave 5 star reviews but it still is very frustrating this is happening. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Is there anything we can even do other than keep reporting the reviews and encouraging more customers to leave us reviews? Getting people to leave reviews feels like pulling teeth. 😅",

I'm not an attorney but I've filed my share of lawsuits in the past, and actually had an attorney disbarred in Louisiana Supreme Court without representation so I know a little about law. \n\nThe first step-if you are serious about stopping this clear disruption to you and your spouse's ability to operate your business (and you are) - is to begin documenting every instance of interference from the very beginning. \n\nNow before you throw your hands up and say you didn't want to go this far with it, if that's the case you are not that serious about this blatant assault on your livelihood. \n\n 1) You are going to have to retain a lawyer. \n\n 2) You need to bring these documents with you to the \n      lawyer\n\n     Evidence \n\n       a. Screenshots of each review (with timestamps and        \n          \n           platform name(s).\n       \n       b. URLS to the review(s) or reviewer(s) profile(s)\n\n\n       c.

Drop in revenue, customer cancellations, or any   \n\n             negative feedback linked to the reviews.\n\n        b.  Internal records showing disruption (e.g. staff \n\n             complaints, lost contracts).\n\n         c. Any analytics showing traffic or customer decline \n\n             (walk ins).\n\n          \n           d.  Bring witnesses to carroborate the impact or\n\n                threats\n\n           e.  Bring all business documents...LLC or corporation.\n\n                 If it is a partnership.\n\n\n        3) Ask the attorney about anti-SLAPP laws in your \n\n             state- these protect free speech and can backfire\n\n             if your case isn't airtight. Might as well ask about \n\n             cost. Remember though , if you win the person you \n\n             are suing has to pay all fees.\n\n             I hope this helped. Good luck .

I feel like there are so many incredible men out there who just need a little guidance with style and environment.\nA lot of guys spend money on dating or communication coaching, but then when a woman actually comes over, the space feels off. The lighting’s harsh or too bright, there’s no music, maybe it smells a little stale or feels cold (literally and emotionally). It’s not that they don’t care, it’s just that no one’s ever taught them how to make a home feel safe and inviting.\nSo I’m thinking of creating a course or guide that teaches men how to transform their space on a budget for under $250 using simple sensory design: lighting, scent, warmth, music, and personal touches.\nI’m also a licensed massage therapist, so I could include a section on the basics of slow, safe, intentional touch to help men understand the connection between physical environment and emotional comfort.\nDoes this sound like something people would actually pay for or be interested in? Any thoughts on how to structure it as a course, digital guide, or coaching?\n",

This all just sounds like what an interior designer would do but just male focused.\n\n...so yea, it depends on how you plan to market it.\n\nThe way you explain it in the post, I feel, makes it seem unappealing and unnecessary (to clientele/men). You may need to shock men into thinking they can't keep a girl without you. I believe in you! Make it undeniable and irresistable. Good luck.",

I think $250 will be a tall order for budget conscious people though unless you actually spend a lot of time setting their place up. Design in general is a tricky space that's hard to do on a budget. A lot of people with small budgets are not willing or capable of valuing your insights. The people who would value your insights tend to be willing to pay thousands for it, but they'll also expect a high level of execution and be coming at you from a much more challenging problem to solve (going from a place that is decent to one that truly sings).\n\nI do like the idea of in general, a PSA existing to help guys be better?

A man can't be everything. This is usually something that women bring to the table. The female touch.\n\nIt's strange that women don't take up the task. I had women offer to give my house a makeover.\n\nWhether it's possible to convince the man that needs this service to spend money on will be a challenge. Their house is cold for the exact reason that they simply don't see it or they see it but not as a big problem. So they might welcome a solution. But they don't value it appropriately.\n\nI know women that have really nice houses. Cozy, bold, even though they themselves say it's a mess I can see that it's her mind that has shaped it with all the choices she made over the years in what she will and will not have in her house. It reflects her personality. It's an art form.\n\nIn that way it will be a risk for a man to hire a service to do this. Since when it's a women she will bring her personality into his space.  He will end up with a interior that is thoughtful but not necessarily bespoke to him.\n\nWhen we then have his dates visit his house they will recognize the work but they will also instantly know that it's not his interior but simply bought as a prop.\n\nSo making a course is way better then to take everything out of his hands.\n\nI think you should partner with other women who like different styles, have them present moodbooks etc so clients can choose in directions they like.\n\nYou could make it in an app. Maybe start by swiping to pinpoint what directions are best first and then expand. You have to present it in a way men like.\n\nOh and since men will be hard to convince to spend money on it, why not make giftcards so women or anyone can give it as a present. Then you get your pay and it's paid for by the women / acquintances who do see the value of your service.",

      "selftext": "\nSo back when I was in my sophomore year, I got this idea to start a small clothing brand. I was broke, drowning in assignments &amp; honestly thought it’d be a fun way to make a little money in college\n\nThe idea was to do retro sports-wear, kinda like those 90s oversized tees with old school fonts and colors. I sketched out a few designs, made a logo on Canva *(yeah I know, rookie move)* &amp; thought I was ready to build a brand overnight 😭\n\nAt first I tried finding local printers but everything was way too expensive. Minimum orders were like 50 shirts and I had no clue if anyone would even buy them. So I started small with print on demand just to test the waters. My friends ordered a few and wore them around campus which actually gave me some confidence\n\nThe hard part wasn’t design, it was figuring out how to get people to care. Marketing was way harder than I expected. I made an Insta page, got like 100 followers, then hit a wall. I didn’t have time to post daily or run ads, and I didn’t wanna beg friends to buy stuff\n\nAfter a few months I basically ran out of steam. I sold maybe 20 shirts total. Nothing crazy but it was fun seeing something I made actually out there in the world\n\nLooking back now, I realize I rushed into it without a real plan. I should’ve done more research on brand positioning and maybe tested more designs before launching\n\nIf any of you have done something similar, what would you have done differently? Like, if you were starting a clothing brand in college today, how would you go about it?",

          "body": "The problem is that if you're selling to college kids, you're competing with the million and one other clothing brands/stores out there, and college kids don't often have a lot of spare money to spend on clothing which isn't mass-produced (and thus extremely cheap).\n\nEither you have a pre-established brand of massive popularity and produce t-shirts (and other merch) with that branding, or you make custom bespoke items for the handful of rich kids on campus, or you're doing something like a custom fast print-on-demand service for students who want a one-off personal or social-group clothing item with a particular theme, and you can deliver faster or more conveniently than local print/design shops (or have on-campus pickup/delivery, or some other factor).\n\n&gt;Like, if you were starting a clothing brand in college today, how would you go about it?\n\nI'd spin up a service to add functional pockets to women's clothing. Call it \"It Has Pockets!\" or similar. Have a way for customers to choose from a variety of pocket styles/sizes/materials, pick up the clothing or have a drop-off point on campus (or a nearby drycleaner or something), add the pockets, drop the clothing back or have it available for pickup. Fast turnaround times and college-centric branding (to start) to emphasize it's a student-run microbusiness. Talk to some tailoring businesses in the area to see what they'd charge to do the same work, to get an idea of market prices and whether it would be simpler to just whitebox/resell their services, do the sewing yourself, or have a couple of part-time employees, maybe even 'work at home' people who are interested in the concept, have the sewing skills, and would prefer you handle pickup/dropoff.",

We’ve done everything we thought we needed to build a real company — and yet, we haven’t had a single paying client so far.\n\nHere’s what we’ve done so far:\n\t•\tFully registered the business legally with insurance and all licenses.\n\t•\tRented a tiny, low-cost office with direct access for equipment and supplies.\n\t•\tSet up a phone line and an online booking system for customers to schedule cleanings.\n\t•\tEven built an AI chatbot to answer questions and help people get quotes automatically.\n\t•\tDesigned the whole brand around eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning — something we really believe in.\n\t•\tRan ads on Facebook and Google for months, testing headlines, visuals, and audiences. Still zero traction.\n\nAt this point, we’re trying to figure out what’s going wrong — whether it’s our offer, our marketing, or something deeper in how we’re presenting ourselves.\n\nSo I’d really appreciate your honest feedback:\n👉 What would you do differently to get clients for a local service business like this?\n👉 Are there marketing channels that actually work for local service companies?\n👉 When you visit a business website, what makes you trust it enough to book — and what makes you leave?\n\nWe even built a full website and booking system with an AI chatbot — I can share the link if anyone’s open to taking a look and giving feedback.\n\nWe’d really appreciate any advice, insights, or even brutal honesty. At this point, we just want to understand what we’re doing wrong before giving up.\n\nThanks for reading — and for any help you can offer.\n\n– Two tired (but still hopeful) small business owners",

There are websites like thumb tack, care.com, even yelp that people go to when looking for cleaning services. Because you have no reviews, offer low or free cleanings to family or friends and have them leave you reviews. You are coming into people’s homes and they are trusting you with a lot, reviews are 95% of the battle. Make sure when people google “cleaning services near me” your company is one of the first ones to come up. Put pictures, ask friends to review, it is important to build community around this type of local business",

In fact, every excellent housecleaner I’ve worked with can barely manage more tech than texting on a smart phone.\n\nAlmost everything you’ve done so far is completely unnecessary to your business model.

I didn’t have a website or chatbot back then, just a clear advert with my cleaning areas, services, and fair starting rates. Within weeks, I got my first few clients, and from there word of mouth took over. That’s really how I built momentum.\n\nSometimes it’s not about how professional or automated your setup looks, it’s about being visible where your target clients actually are. Cleaning is a trust-based business. Most people want to hire someone they’ve either met, seen recommended, or been referred to.\n\nHere’s what helped me and what I’d recommend:\n\n1. Advertise locally.\nPost on Gumtree, Facebook Marketplace, and Nextdoor. Keep your message simple and friendly. List your area, what kinds of cleans you offer (regular, deep, end of tenancy, etc.), and your starting rate. People don’t always want to fill long booking forms — they just want someone who can come soon and do a good job.\n\n\n2. Join cleaning groups.\nFacebook cleaning business groups and cleaner referral groups are gold. Try ones like Professional Cleaners UK, Cleaning Business Owners Network, or your local “Cleaners in [your city]” group. You’ll get tips, referrals, and sometimes subcontract work when other cleaners are overbooked.\n\n\n3. Be bold with offers.\nIf you can afford it, offer an introductory discount , for example:\n\n&gt; “First 5 clients get a 2.5-hour basic clean at cost price.”\nIt gives people a reason to try you and helps you build reviews, photos, and trust.\n\n\n\n4. Build local relationships.\nI made a point of getting friendly with concierge staff in apartment buildings. That alone opened a lot of doors because they often know who’s moving in or out and can recommend cleaners on the spot. Drop them your card or a flyer, and thank them if they send someone your way.\n\n\n5. Collect reviews and photos.\nAfter every clean, politely ask clients if you can take a before-and-after photo and if they’d mind leaving a short Google review. That builds your credibility fast.\n\n\n6. Stay active on your Google Business Profile.\nUpdate photos, respond to reviews, and post occasionally. Even one or two good reviews can make a huge difference when people search “cleaner near me.”\n\n\n\nYou’ve done the hardest part already, setting up the structure. Now it’s about visibility, networking, and trust. Once you get your first few jobs and people see your results, it snowballs.",

You can have all the right systems and a great brand, but until people actually meet you, it's just another company online. Others have made excellent recommendations.

Frankly, so did I and so do many of us and it's very correctable.\n\nThe core issue is you expanded business overhead (added costs) before having the revenue to pay for it (paying clients). I imagine you did this thinking an office, website, and social presence were necessary for getting work - that when someone was looking for a cleaning company they would want to see a level of professionalism and, well, success! But that is not how clients measure most service industries.\n\nIf I asked you what the most important factor is in hiring painters to paint your bedroom a different color, you would probably say \"doing the job right and without issue\". Does this relate to their office or their website experience? You likely see the error at this point.\n\nSo brass tacks, this is a list of things you can do to get your business up and running: (1) Get business cards, (2) Go to referral groups (google these) and hand out cards, (3) find your local chamber of commerce and go to their mixers and hand out cards, (4) ask your family or friends if you can do a cleaning for them for free to get some before and after pictures, (5) post said pictures online, (6) ask family and friends to leave google reviews for you, (7) consider terminating your office lease until you have so much business going on that you MUST have an office with dedicated staff, (8) post cleaning memes (yes, really - don't take yourself seriously).\n\nWhat you should expect is to get alot of \"interest\" initially but few inbound phone calls or emails. Focus on meeting people, giving them a reason to try your service, and maintaining that relationship. Over the next 90 days, I would expect that you begin to collect a modest group of repeat customers.",

Being in the field of IT and having already some clients through referrals would be enough to kick off with marketing.\n\nUsually you would have 3 options. Hire a freelancer, hire in-house or hire with a marketing company/agency.\n\nHiring freelancer might be the most economical, but need to be careful, lots of people in freelancing might promise but under-deliver for what you've paid. But once you find a great one with honest work, it will be great asset for the business. Just heads up with the professionals. Always ask for referrals and previous work. \n\nHiring in-house is ratherly expensive these days and also there is the process of hiring. But you have the option to choose a great experienced marketer which could pay itself off. The only issue with this is really the cost to the business.\n\nHiring a company/agency might feel a little better but there's a similar issue to the freelancers which is over-promising but under-delivering, only under a contract. I would say hiring a company is the riskiest because of the contracts. But if you work with a company that's great at their jobs and at least can provide a fine ROI, they will be reliable partner. Cost is more than freelancer but usually less than in-house but it has an advantage because you hire a whole team.\n\n\nThere is also a +1 option which is to learn yourself, but as you've said, it's time consuming and even more time consuming to master it. But once you've master it, there are no additional costs you would have to pay. \n\nI just wanted to point out the important details during your search. As long as you don't fall for false promises you're all good. Important to always keep in mind \"no one can promise or guarantee results in the field of marketing\"\n\nIf you would like to, we can just discuss further. Not trying to pitch myself, but I can share some of expertise if you don't know the market at all.",

A home page can’t rank for every service and every location. You make pages specific for each one so they have a better shot at ranking and being found. \n\nThen there’s blogging.

This will bring visitors to the site and add more content and authority in Google’s eyes. A good blog answers questions. \n\nNext is get off fiver.

So your kpi's would be: how many visited your site, signed up to x marketing thing, contacted you etc. \nThey then need to be able to onboard those new eads &amp; prospects into a sales funnel - offers for early adopters, promo's, relationship building, whatever your end goal is or your own success metrics are. \nSo these 3 steps should be part of your person's competencies: identifying target markets, route to those markets (lead gen &amp; digital and/or traditional marketing) and 3rdly conversion into sales plan. You want to see the best plan they have. And you'll want to set kpi's for each stage, so if they underperform, you wind it up with them.",

          "body": "Do not make AI ads, it's very obvious to saavy clients and immediately paints you as cheap. It's the equivalent of putting up a quick and dirty billboard made with microsoft word\n\nYour kind of work is not about big picture marketing, you just need to pay for search ads and those ads need to lead to an attractive landing page that is good at generating leads. Yes technically this is marketing but you don't need to be hitting up social media or paying for TV ads or anything like that.\n\nOnce you have a good looking functional website with good SEO and a well done landing page for your paid ads, it's basically set and forget. This admittedly is a whole can of worms to learn in of itself but seeing as you make websites already half the battle you can do yourself. It is worthwhile effort to learn effort if you're at all good with research and happen to have the time (because its slow). Alternatively you can outsource this to a google ads/SEO manager, which can be worth it. I'd find someone reputable local to do help you if you decide you have the budget to do it vs doing it yourself because ads/SEO people are a minefield of wannabes, scammers, and fake results. Maybe you can reach out to one of your current/past clients who seem to have a good ad/web presence and ask who they use?\n\nExpect to spend something like 10-15% on revenue on ads + management of them by the way if you want good results. It's worth it. We went through a slump at the beginning of this year and started spinning ads up for the first time. It's been a learning process but its absolutely paid for itself within the first month. For your industry in particular you could probably benefit from a real SEO guy you pay monthly on contract (again, ask locally), because to really kill it on the SEO front requires posting lots of relevant articles a month to your website involving your field. This signals to google that you're an authority on the subject (plus GPT searches really like that kind of content), and for your type of business coming off as an authority on information relating to what you do is valuable (vs a restaurant or a mill shop where its less useful). At least that's how it was last I checked - the google SEO landscape changes all the damn time so maybe posting frequent articles isn't so hot right now. But yeah - a good SEO guy will completely take care of all of that for you. \n\nAlso it should be said - focus on local. Go to business networking meetups, find other businesses and be seen in person. Get coffee/lunch dates with people you want to connect with. This builds healthy foundations and relationships for your business which are the real secret to success.",

          "body": "14 hours a month sounds pretty reasonable for an 18 month old Saas especially if you're chasing invoices and dealing with bookkeeper back and forth. You're not being slow.\n\n  \nThe annoying truth is that most of those hours are probably spent on a mix of things - some you can automate and some you can't. Invoice chasing is just a reality of b2b unfortunately. Timesheets and invoicing workflows depend a lot on your specific setup.\n\nThe receipts and expense tracking side got way easier for us when we switched to Ramp - that cut down on a chunk of the bookkeeper questions and manual reconciliation stuff. \n\nAt 40k MRR you're probably right that a full time finance person is premature, but you might be at the point where a part time bookkeeper who does more than just answer your questions could take some of this off your plate. Or even a VA for invoice follow ups. The goal isn't to get to 0 hours (impossible) but getting it under 5 to 7 hours seems doable with the right automation + delegation.\n\n  \nHope it helped :)",

          "body": "The secret to success in a paper/stationery store today is creating an experience and community that online retailers can’t replicate, while being strategic about your product mix.\n\nHere are the key elements:\nFind your niche identity. Don’t try to compete with Amazon on basic office supplies. Instead, become the destination for something specific: beautiful Japanese stationery, bullet journaling supplies, luxury fountain pens, eco-friendly products, or locally-designed goods. People will travel and pay premium prices for specialty items they can touch and test.\n\nMake it tactile and experiential. Your biggest advantage is that customers can feel paper weights, test pens, see colors in person, and discover products they didn’t know existed. Create testing stations, offer workshops on calligraphy or bookbinding, host journaling meetups. The store should be a place people want to spend time, not just transact.\n\nBuild community. Stationery enthusiasts are passionate and congregate online, but crave real-world connection. Become a hub for local artists, students, planners, and writers. Host events, feature local creators, maintain a social media presence that celebrates your customers’ creativity.\n\nCurate thoughtfully. Stock what big boxes don’t: independent brands, imports, artist collaborations, and products with stories. People shopping small want to feel they’re discovering something special.\nDiversify revenue. Add services like custom printing, monogramming, gift wrapping, or even a small café corner. Consider subscription boxes or strong online/local delivery to supplement foot traffic.\n\nThe stores thriving now are destinations with personality, not just retail spaces. With this in mind, you can add a complimentary business within the space.\n\nA complementary business can drive foot traffic, increase average transaction value, and make your space a destination. Here are some winning combinations:\n\nCoffee/Tea Bar - This is probably the most natural pairing. People browse stationery, then sit with a latte to journal or write cards. It encourages lingering, creates ambiance, and the profit margins on beverages are excellent. You could even theme drinks around products (“The Moleskine Mocha”).\n\nPrint/Copy Services - Custom printing, business cards, invitations, zine printing. You already have paper-loving customers; offer them services too. Wedding invitation consultations can be particularly lucrative.\n\nGift Wrapping Station - Not just supplies but a premium wrapping service. During holidays this could be a significant revenue stream, and it positions your store as a gifting destination.\n\nBookstore/Book Section - Small press books, local authors, beautiful editions, journals and planners. The customer overlap is nearly perfect, and it extends browsing time.\n\nArt Supplies Corner - Watercolors, brush pens, sketchbooks. Many stationery lovers also draw or do hand-lettering.\n\nVinyl/Record Selection - Sounds random, but hear me out: both attract collectors who appreciate physical media and craftsmanship. Creates an interesting vibe and crossover appeal.\n\nWorkshop/Event Space - Rent it out for small meetings, creative workshops, book clubs. Generates income during off-hours and builds community.\n\nThe best choice depends on your interests (you’ll be managing it!), your local market gaps, and your space constraints. What draws you? Or what’s missing in your area?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Maybe even same day local delivery.\n\nI love stationery, and I love going to stationery stores, but since I stopped working in the city I never have chance to get to one, and I'm certainly not going to travel to one when I can fire up amazon. I don't even use the website of the art shop I used to go to, because amazon will get things to me tomorrow, and that's what you're up against.\n\nI think you could really embrace the local community with same day local delivery or similar? Click and collect style service at a minimum.\n\nIf there's room, then obvious complementary services are renting out spray booths, taking order for  3D printing, CnC machines etc.\n\nAnd as cliche as it sounds, if you can find room for a coffee and cake area, you'll find a lot of people who love art shops also love to spend hours in there - providing sustenance at a profit is a fairly logical move. You'll probably find that it doesn't need to be the final work in high end coffee, just something to keep them going whilst they doodle on a sofa or table.\n\nI would also say if you can turn it into something else of an evening, like push the shelves back and have some poetry nights, or comedy, or small live music, basically turn yourself into a arts hub, not just a shop for pencils during the day.\n\nI'll be honest though, this definitely has vibes of art / stationery being a passion of yours, and you wanting to make a living from it...which is great, but is rarely a recipe for success. You really need to know if there's actually a market for it before you commit to anything else, and if you've not worked retail before, speak to someone who runs their own small store, because it's a huge time and money drain getting stocked and opened, and then the hours can be a real bitch, to be frank.",

Started my greeting card line out of my house in 2013; had an Etsy shop and did lots of pop-ups and markets, and developing my wholesale line before going for it full-time a couple years later.\n\nI’ve had a brick and mortar since 2016. Even in a tourist town and having my own line where the margins are much better, it’s still an uphill battle. I’ve taught workshops and have a good social media presence. I was married, and while his paycheck certainly provided the stability to take risks, I’ve worked really hard to keep this thing afloat.\n\nThe space I was in from 2017-2024 was a giant storefront on Magazine street where we had our letterpress studio in the back, visible for people to see us making the cards. Cool in theory, but not enough to justify the massive overhead. The front half of the store was way too big for what we sold best (cards, pens, stickers, wrapping paper), so I filled it with gifty crap that diluted my brand. Required a big team and lots of capital to keep the inventory stocked. High gross sales, but barely breaking even.\n\nLast year, I moved my print studio to a big, cheap warehouse space, and moved the shop to a tiny jewel box in a fancier part of the neighborhood. Pivoted to custom wedding invitations.\n\nThe business is finally profitable for the first time in years. I’m really proud of myself. There’s no rich husband, just a scrappy gal with a lot of creativity.\n\nGreeting cards are our bread &amp; butter. It’s something people don’t turn to Amazon for, and love the experience of shopping the wall in person on their way to an event— and yes, we can gift wrap that for you too!\n\nOur pen wall is a big focus and it’s so fun seeing people light up at the rainbow of Gelly rolls they can try out. \n\nWe have built an amazing community of regulars and meet new fans of the brand every day. \n\nI don’t have all the answers, I’ve pivoted so many times I’m still dizzy from the COVID years.

The advertised rate seemed reasonable, but after signing the contract, I discovered the true cost was closer to $55/hour when you factor in mandatory cleaning fees, storage charges, and equipment usage fees that weren't mentioned upfront.\n\nThis got me thinking - how many other food entrepreneurs get blindsided by these hidden kitchen rental costs? I've talked to other caterers and ghost kitchen operators who've had similar experiences where the advertised rate was 30-50% lower than what they actually ended up paying.\n\nWhat hidden costs have you encountered in your food business operations, and how do you vet potential kitchen spaces to avoid these surprises?",

If you have to, upload it into ChatGPT and prompt it to summarize the contract as if you were a 5-year-old.  Then prompt it to tell you all of the hidden costs and total them.\n\nNow that you have them and understand them, shop for another kitchen space while negotiating the contract terms.  Your business depends on a solid relationship with the lessor…taking the time to go over the details with him/her and finding something that works for both of you can be beneficial.  At the very least, it makes you look like a valuable partner rather than just a lessee.\n\nRemember, though, they got to this point through trial and error to make their business run without a lot of hiccups, and you’re now a hiccup to them by negotiating rather than just accepting the terms.  You have to give something to create value for them, not just take for yourself.\n\nAnd…now that you’ve been in business for a year, try raising your prices by 5% to start making those hidden costs back.  That 5% will bring in new clients and force others to drop off, leaving you with a stronger client base and more revenues.  You’ll also find it easier to attract higher-paying clients and make smarter investments in services that will meet their needs, continuing the virtuous circle.",

      "selftext": "If you're considering Gusto, avoid it like the plague. Our small business has used them religiously since 2022 with many issues caused by bad CS advice, but here's the straw that broke the camel's back: We had 1 returned payment of \\~$500 this last week as we migrated bank accounts. Now Gusto is demanding we wire the funds in advance. Called CS, who was very nice, but explained that they are unable to do anything because their team in assurance won't take phone calls or call me back to discuss. The CS rep was extremely nice and patient with me, but the Gusto policy here is absolutely crazy.\n\nTLDR; avoid Gusto. They used to be great a few years back, but they've increasingly lost their way and it's not getting better.\n\nEdit --- it wasn't an entire payroll that got returned. It was a single ACH of $500 when we process 40x this each week in payroll with them. They then reprocessed it the next day and it cleared. Not saying I wasn't ultimately responsible, but Gusto has zero risk or liability here. They didn't process the payment and when I went to run payroll for the following week - wire required. No call, no conversation, and customer service couldn't transfer me to the team responsible to explain the situation. ",

Once everything’s running smoothly, maintenance is usually just a few hours a month.\n\nTrying to patch it yourself isn’t sustainable, it’s eating into your focus and growth.

          "body": "I didn't see anyone mention this, but it's time to build KM (Knowledge Management) capability in your small business. This is more than just a tech issue.   \n  \nYour business continuity is at stake if you or an employee get sick, quit, get hospitalized or something unforseen, family emergency, etc. Also, when adding more employees later, you want them at near 100% as quickly as possible, so a proper onboarding &amp; offboarding &amp; knowledge capture/sharing process will help you long-term, and make your company as a whole more valuable if you one-day want to sell it so the new owner can jump right in.  \n  \nBut here are some items you might want to look into: \n\n1. A proper CMS (Content Management System). Not just a file dump, a secure space for collaboration where all files are tracked.   \n  \n2. A strict taxonomy like Customer Name, Project Name, Project Number, Type of file (Requirements, Schedule, Mockups, etc), etc...  \n  \n3. Version control - every change creates a new file, and information about the changes should be written by the developer.\n\n4. File Check out/Check in - it will show you who's using the file and shouldn't be messed with until that person is \n\n5. All files should be stored in the CMS, and the CMS should have a strict backup schedule onsite &amp; cloud. \n\n6. Consider a backup tool for each of your employees laptops, in the event something happened, you could have it autorestore to a new laptop in a few hours without losing your time. You can even look through different cloud backups and copy the exact files you need.\n\n7. Not sure how you manage your projects, if its all informal (emails, chats, site visits, video calls, excel spreadsheets), but consider a tracking system separate from your CMS, that allows you or anyone to manage tasks using a ticketing type of system. This allows you in the future to have account managers + project managers + secretary + devs all interacting with the clients and adding to the project - if a dev gets sick, a new one can jump in and follow the ticket thread and be ready. Clients get frustrated when they called in a change, but that information didn't get shared in time.\n\nAll in all, this is a tech + people + process type of situation, hiring only an IT firm/person might only fix part of the problem now, but as you grow or the organization evolves there might be more headaches along the way.\n\nGood Luck!",

They'll centralize your files and get you on a proper backup system asap.  \n  \nEven with organized files, you'll still get a million \"where is the X file?\" questions.
