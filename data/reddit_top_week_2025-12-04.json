I spent approx 8 hours making the first product for myself after I couldn’t find anyone selling it on Etsy. So then I thought I’d risk the $22 start up cost and see if anyone else would buy it for $3.  The next day someone did. By the end of week 2, I was selling nearly a hundred a day of the same identical product. \n\nSo that first 3-4 months or so, I invested my initial 8 hours time on the product, plus 1 hour to make an Etsy store, then approx 10-15 minutes a week answering questions/messages. I made approx $5k in that time.\n\nAfter that I invested a solid week of 15 hour days at home on my computer making new products for same niche field, after having spent an afternoon browsing online to see what others were interested in.\n\nAfter that full week of about 100 hours invested, I could go back to spending ten minutes a week answering questions for the rest of the year.  \n\nDid the same this year- spent one week with at least 100 hours invested in making new products, now just saved in drafts and I release one a week and answer a few messages. For as long as this lasts it’s been an absolute fucking dream come true. \n\nI think the key piece to my success was that I was myself looking for something on Etsy that no one else was selling yet, and I offered it for cheap ($2.99). I had no competition which meant that initially I had about a solid month of nearly a hundred sales a day. I’ve made $70k from it in last two years which means after Etsy fees and taxes that’s still about $2k/month for an averaged of ten hours a month. It ended up being more take home pay than my 9-5 job.  BUT it has no benefits or pension, so I’d caution anyone about quitting their day job if they have a pension or health benefits!",

There are people who turn this into a real full time business! Another thing I’m considering doing is renting my driveway parking spot to long term parkers who use the airport. I don’t use it anyway and from what I’ve seen in my area you can pull an extra $300-$500 a month depending on the area and even more if you offer “free transport” to and from the airport which I would not do. There are literally so many ways to pull a few extra bucks out of the ol turnip! Good luck with your endeavors.",

          "body": "A couple I have had success with led back to leveraging a skill you have that would take too much time for someone to learn. \n\n1) Woodworking / Laser Engraving: Able to produce handmade customized items for people. A big time investment and not a lot of evergreen demand, but this year I've made an extra 14,000 in November just selling on the marketplace for Christmas gifts. Barrier to entry is tools and equipment and needing skills. Spend about 2 hours a day and 10 hours on my day off. \n\n2) Drywall repair: I focused on doing small repair jobs without paint. After a plumber or electrician came in and cut up the wall, getting a larger drywall company was difficult for customers. I would keep 2*2 sheets in my car and would tape and hot mud over a few days. I do a lot of small repairs in apartments and a couple of student houses.I reached out to contractors and painters and get 7-10 referrals a week. Usually convert 60%. Makes about 2-4k a month with materials cost of 3-500. Barrier is you need to know how to repair drywall well. It's about an hour to meet the customer and quote with a little followup. Takes about 5 hours spread over 2-3 days to do the jobs. \n\n3) Installing POS: Installing square or Shopify POS systems for small businesses. Setting up inventory management. Training. This is a great one. I can charge a premium. I network with the chamber of commerce and local fb groups. I charge $1000.00 for initial set up, and $300.00 a month for support and ongoing training. The value is that business owners are able to track sales accurately and the POS becomes critical to running their business Depending on sku count might be between 6-10 hours for the initial set up. I have about 6k a month coming in for residual income. I've used not to charge for the initial set up, but I found by charging the up front cost I was able to eliminate customers who didn't see the value and didn't want to spend money on their systems. Barrier is you need to know how the various systems work but no overhead or expenses to operate as I have my customers purchase / lease the equipment and licenses in their name. Plan a full 8 hours for the initial set up. Once set up I check in biweekly and may have to go out for an hour to train new employees or work out kinks. \n\nEdit: Added times",

It's filled with bottom feeders now because the barrier to entry has been lowered significantly with AI. \n\nI know that's not what you're asking for, BUT there is a niche within it that I started exploring early this year. It's proven to be exceptionally ripe, and now I make most of my income from that rather than convential development projects, and it even outperforms a few of my own MicroSaaS products.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is Bug Bounties. Tons of companies, pretty much all top tech firms, and tons of tech heavy blue chip companies as well offer these programs. You find a bug in one of their products, create a report, and submit it to their bounty platform. If it's accepted, they pay you, and often times, big cash. The bigger the bug, the bigger the bounty. \n\nIt's not even that hard. There is a barrier to entry, but it's not that high. With the AI race tech firms are spewing out products as fast as they can make them. The Silicon Valley motto of \"move fast and break shit\" is in full effect. \n\nI made $8500 just off the Gemini 3 launch, not just with Google but with all the companies using their AI API's on things like AI Studio and Vertex. \n\nIt probably won't last forever, I'm sure the bottom feeders will breach this niche soon enough as well. But for now there is really good money to be made.",

You basically find what some state government needs (random items), buy them, and then resell to them. Basic arbitrage.\n\nThe Model:\n\nCreate an LLC -&gt; You create an account on state/federal government contracting websites, register as a supplier -&gt; look for bids within procurement (e.g. some state government needs a trailer, wood, glass, etc.) -&gt; you find whatever the government needs online from some vendor -&gt; submit the bid to the government by pricing the material x% more than what you think you can get it for -&gt; Hope you’re the lowest bidder -&gt; win the bid and profit the difference between how much the government will pay you (your bid) and how much you have to pay the vendor you have found.\n\nKnow several people getting started in it and it has been incredibly successful for them. Feel free to look up some YT vids but do NOT sign up for a course. It’s easy enough that you can do so yourself. Don’t expect crazy margins on most items, profits will really just come from volume (so so so many opportunities there)\n\nYou’ll need ~$1500-$2000 to start (this isn’t really your expense, just what you need to buy the thing you are reselling)",

Well under £150/$200 to start.\n\nWhat I charge (real numbers):\n\t•\tEarly projects: £350–£500 ($450–$650) setup to get quick proof.\n\t•\tCurrent range: £600–£750 ($750–$950) setup + £150–£300 ($200–$350)/mo to keep posts live, monitor leads, and tweak follow-ups.\n\t•\tMy close rate from 25 personalised Loom audits is usually 1–3 clients if the audit is specific.\n\nResults I’ve seen (typical, not guaranteed):\n\t•\tReply time: hours → minutes (instantly via text).\n\t•\tShow rate: +10–30% once reminders/reschedule links go in.\n\t•\tCalls/enquiries from Maps: a clear bump within 10–14 days when the profile was messy to begin with.\n\nHow I’d test it in 7 days:\n\t1.\tPick one niche you understand.\n\t2.\tBuild a scrappy demo + 2-minute Loom walkthrough.\n\t3.\tSend 25 personalised audits to local owners (no mass spam).\n\t4.\tLand one paid job, deliver in 48 hours.\n\t5.\tCapture one metric (“no-shows down 22%” or “8 enquiries this week vs 3 last week”).\n\t6.\tAsk for a one-line testimonial.\n\t7.\tRaise price 20% and repeat.\n\nIf you want totally offline, the same logic applies to window-cleaning routes / Airbnb changeovers / mobile car valeting — sell an outcome, prove it fast, lock in a recurring slot. \n\nBut the “Book-More-Jobs” bundle has been the steadiest earner per hour for me.",

The Rover community, in my experience is incredible,  the dog owners are nice &amp; I've yet to have an issue with any dogs that I've cared for.\n\nYou get to set your own rates, services, preferences on types of pets. Rover does take a % but it is WORTH IT! The services they offer, insurance &amp; assistance is well worth whatever % they take TRUST ME ON THIS.\n\nIf an animal gets lost while in your care, they do EVERYTHING THEY CAN to get that animal back. The will pay other sitters to volunteer in your area to go on searches &amp; post flyers that ROVER pays for. They pay those volunteers a set rate on a daily basis if I'm not mistaken \n\nOnce you've become somewhat established &amp; obviously provide good services, the customers just kept flocking to me. There were times I had to decline requests because I just couldn't do it.\n\nMy services were doggy day care &amp; boarding. I had my customers bring their dogs to me, had two of my own &amp; would host up to 2 additional dogs (3 of they were from the same household). Puppies are EXTRA $$ because they require EXTRA attention.\n\nId get long term boarders &amp; that was really nice $.\n\nPlus, in San Diego &amp; Las Vegas, almost all of my customers always gave me a cash tip at the end of their stay.\n\nTIPS:\n- make sure your calendar is updated &amp; confirmed\n\n- respond to requests ASAP!!!!\n\n- be very communicative and honest\n\n- if you have pets, suggest a MEET &amp; GREET\n\n-Ask questions (i.e. is leash free dog park OK? Any special blankets/toys that they have to help them calm nerves? especially about the dogs preferences &amp; what they do in particular situations? Have they ever been left with a stranger, how did they react? ETC.)\n\n- SEND PIX &amp; VIDEOS intermittently throughout the day\n\n- complete REVIEWS asap, focus on the Positives of your experience with the Animal  &amp; their Human.\n\nRemember not only are these strangers trusting you with their Prides &amp; Joys, you are providing a Service.\nHope this helps.",

          "body": "I was in the same situation not long ago. Everything I looked at either paid almost nothing or needed another 15–20 hours a week. I finally found something that fits realistically.\n\nI started running wellness scans using a Quantum Resonance Magnetic Analyzer, which is a non-invasive scan that reads the body’s biofrequency signals and generates a super detailed report. I had zero medical background and it was still really easy to learn. Each scan takes 5–7 minutes and an appointment is usually 20-30 minutes total. I charge $60 per scan (you could charge more or less!) and I make a portion of the sale if I can sell the client supplements which are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier. \n\nThe service is flexible, allowing me to book scans whenever I want. The good income per scan means I don’t need to do a ton of them. There’s no inventory or driving around delivering products. People genuinely love the service and refer others, and there’s a really supportive community that helps with setup, training, scripts, client resources, and more, which made it much less overwhelming.\n\nJust to be totally upfront there is an optional affiliate side if someone wants to also earn by helping others get started, but you absolutely don’t need to recruit or build a team to make money. I just started with doing scans themselves and that alone has been awesome.\n\nRight now there’s actually a Black Friday sale where the scanner is $300 CAD. \n\nFor anyone business-minded and health-minded, this would be a great opportunity! If anyone is curious or wants to see what a scan looks like or how to set it up, send me a message!",

      "selftext": " This month I picked up a small side gig making short videos for a kids story series. A tiny publisher wanted simple storybook style clips for socials and their site, two to three minutes each, calm pacing and very soft visuals,so we agreed to base everything on their “Kids Storybook” template inside MovieFlow. We agreed on 75 dollars per episode, they ordered 12, so I cleared about 900 dollars on top of my main job.\n\nThe pipeline is simple enough. They send me the story text and age range. I clean it up into a read aloud script, drop it into MF to get a first long storybook style cut, then do small tweaks in a regular editor like CapCut or Resolve Free intro, outro, timing fixes, light audio cleanup. Now that I have a rhythm each episode takes around 30 mins to 45 mins end to end.\n\nFor me this works because it is fully remote, the visual expectations are reasonable, and the heavy lifting of turning a full script into a watchable sequence sits on the tools instead of me hand building every frame in a timeline. Right now I am just treating it as a clean little sidehustle that fits into evenings without wrecking the rest of my week.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys. I made a post a few weeks ago about automating the recycling at a restaurant. I can't link it because the automod removes it for having a link but I already automated a Mexican restaurants recycling by setting them up with the recyclers who automatically pick everything up once a week and I get to keep the money. My main job is to get rid of the cans if the truck doesn't show up. \n\nI went to the restaurant next door and asked the owner what they were doing with their recycling and they said they weren't bothering even to recycle. He accepted but the guy wanted me to come every other day to move bottles from one side of the building to the other so I said I couldn't commit to that but turns out the owner is opening a massive restaurant next week. A 100+ table giant German bar. He said I can set up the recycling for him there. I told him in return, I'll help him out a little with their social media posts. That was good enough for them.\n\nHe asked a few questions about how I do it but I kept it vague.\n\nIt so happens a very close friend is going to start working next week as the face of the bar and I already wanted to help him out anyway! I had already given him a ton of ideas and I can do the social media posts super fast and easy but to them they think I'm some sort of wizard lol. \n\nI may get another AUD $5,000 to $10,000 out of this one. This place is 5X bigger than the first restaurant. I'm now thinking of ways to also get their other restaurant by suggesting they drop the stuff at my bins. Just need to talk to the property owner to see if he's ok with the space situation. \n\nMan. At this point I think I'm going to hit every restaurant in town 😆. It's like shooting fish in a barrell. Nobody knows of this recycling scheme. I haven't seen any of the branded bins anywhere.",

Build it into an event space and keep it nicer looking inside with a lounge/meeting area for office team building bullshit. There’s not going to be an axe throwing league like bowling, there is never enough seating at ours for people to “hang out.” So it just becomes this transactional axe place for jobs to write off for HR documentation of team building",

      "selftext": "I currently run a small online shop selling home goods (ceramics, decor, etc.). Margins are okay, but I’m trying to add a consumable product to get customers coming back more often than once a year. I want to start with a small, curated selection of high-quality matcha since it fits my aesthetic and customer base.\n\nThe hard part is the sourcing. I'm looking for a wholesale matcha supplier that is geared towards small resellers, meaning the quality is high (ceremonial grade) but the minimum order quantities aren't as insane. I need decent margins to make it worth the hassle.\n\nI’ve been testing One With Tea because I use them personally and like the quality, and their wholesale program seems small-biz friendly. But before I commit to a bulk order, I wanted to ask: has anyone else here had success white-labeling or reselling matcha/tea? ",

          "body": "What kind of prices are we talking about here? There is also a difference between ceremonial matcha and regular culinary grade matcha.\n\nOn top of that, a big reason good quality matcha is expensive is because the good matcha only comes from a particular environment that includes soil acidity, weather (including wind strength). It's very similar to wine grapes that require particular acidity and soil composition to be good. Over time, the soil changes, but in many areas that produce matcha, you still have an inferior product compared to certain fields and areas that it is grown.",

          "body": "I suppose you are whether or not you should go into education as in teaching. There are some benefits to a teaching position. You will have more time off than other professions and if you have children in school your vacation time will most likely mirror their vacation time. In addition, the retirement is not too bad. Many will disagree with me. I have known several people who have done nothing but hop from one job to the next for the last 30 years. I have no clue how they think they will receive a retirement. They have no pensions and have only paid into Social Security sporatically. One of my friends from high school actually had a certificate in sterlizing tools for medical procedures. I understand that the pay was decent. Unfortunately, she hopped out that job and started work for a convenience store. I think her retirement will include working in order to afford to put food on her table. I knew several people who have done the same thing as she did. It was as if it was a disease. \n\nAs far as going back to school. I knew some people in college who were older than me. No one thinks less of them. I never did. As long as you are serious about your goal it is possible. There is nothing wrong with it. You must put your mind into it and go the long haul to the finish line to get your degree, certificate, or whatever your goal is. Whatever the field is try to talk to someone who is in that field so you can get more information about and possibly how that job will do in the future.  As far as a new trade- if I were you I would make sure that I was compatible with that trade. Good luck.",

Build routines and follow it, most of the time procrastinating can be solved by simply knowing what you have to do next and keeping yourself occupied. Start with putting stuff up on your calendar, there are plenty of productivity tools and techniques you can search for. Most importantly, try to remove yourself from your distractions or atleast try to mitigate it as much as possible when you are in your productive state. \n\nFor example I have browser extensions to block YouTube and social media during certain hours. I actively try to only watch movies than a TV series because I know I’m a terrible binge watcher. And I also try to be outside as much as I can to be around people which sort of keeps me in check because I’m away from all the distractions at my home. \n\nAlso try to reward yourself with a break now and again or plan a fun activity for sticking with your tasks, you can literally put this on your calendar.",

I end up with these terrible phone photos taken in my workshop with garbage lighting and cluttered backgrounds.\n\nI got tired of fighting with Photoshop and writing AI prompts from scratch every time so I started building an app that just does it for me. Take a photo of an object, pick a background, tweak the lighting, and it generates something that actually looks professional.\n\nStill working on it but it's getting pretty cool. I originally just wanted it for my own portfolio stuff but I keep thinking about how many people selling things online probably deal with the same issue. Not everyone has room for a lightbox or money to pay a photographer for every listing.\n\nAnyway it's not done yet but I'm getting close. Put up a waitlist if you want to know when it's ready. Mostly just excited to share what I've been working on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s9w7xulq4g1.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=897e8293f8052f408788438cf30259b9e23ad60d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1udb8xulq4g1.jpg?width=947&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccdd4c5c32cdeea89864473c94ef9fa441c13361\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gipko8xulq4g1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eb7facb216dc804d3af8883bd6ed496335a4ab8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwtqd8xulq4g1.jpg?width=1206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7750529896dfde962bc7669a16b193e0fdd0965c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amt208xulq4g1.jpg?width=1205&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606e6e2205e905b78faae04e37b71fb667676b4f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wxbm8xulq4g1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27f732fdaafbb1e59df4481f2815cb469ffb5e41\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/159s68xulq4g1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7932177b5a0ee192bd6d62fa061662a8fed007\n\nWhat do you all do for product photos currently?

I’ve hired tutor for my kids online and the price isn’t cheap. You can easily make 20-50 hourly. People that helps kids study for their SAT is even higher. You can tutor for foreign students who wants to learn English too. Bonus if you and your spouse wants a free vacation- teaching English in Japan or Korea. I know a few who did this for the summer to pay for grad school tuition. They loved it cause they can immerse in new culture, have a place to stay, it’s a working vacation that helps them pay for school. If your tech savvy, help senior citizens who needs help setting up their smart phone and helping teach them how to use it, teach them the basic of how to use their computer or emails. But to me staying at home and doing online teaching is the best. Set up a platform in Etsy and make teaching flash cards- my daughter did this. She spent a few hours in the computer doing pdf files people can download. Once she got it uploaded she left it alone til someone pays for it. It’s not much but she’s in high school and good enough for her to buy stuff she wants. \n\nWith pallets you will still need to put out some investment capital. Money begets money right. I’m just thinking of ways you can earn the money you want without upfront capital investment. In this day and age, you can literally sell ideas. Capitalized on that. I don’t know what’s your educational background, but I was in your position once upon a time and hubby and I became a consultant by accident. We just wanted to do something together. I’m bored being at home all day. So he found a contract and together we found companies and people who can handle it. No upfront cost to us, we didn’t even register our company until our ducks were in a row. We didn’t see clients, everything was online. We couldn’t travel because we have a sick child that is often in the hospital. But we made it work. I’m sure you can too.",

You see it on fb marketplace and basically it’s in warehouses that you go to for pick up. They also have return good from Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot that are sold by the pallets. I see people resell them a lot on flea markets. But question to ask yourself is, do you have the space to store your inventory. If your going to resell it in person you also need to figure out your logistics, you mentioned you vehicle is on the older side. If you cannot unload your pallet inventory where are you going to store it? It’s an additional cost to you if you have to rent a truck or storage unit.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building simple niche sites + funnels for a while. Nothing fancy — $300 to $1500 range, depending on the complexity. Most clients are decent, but yesterday I got hit with something that honestly made me sit and stare at my screen for a minute.\n\nA guy messages me saying he wants a “professional website to launch his online fitness coaching.” Cool. I ask the usual questions — pages needed, content, branding, integrations, etc. He says “everything,” meaning homepage, services, testimonials, booking calendar, email automation, the works.\n\nI send him my normal quote. He replies:\n\n**“Nah man, that’s way too much. AI can build websites for free now. I’ll give you $50 because you’re basically just clicking buttons.”**\n\nI genuinely thought he was joking. But He wasn’t.\n\nHe went on a whole rant about how “AI makes web designers obsolete,” and how I should be \"grateful\" to get work while I still can. Meanwhile, he’s expecting a complete business-ready website with design, copywriting, branding, integrations, responsive layout… for the price of a pizza.\n\nWhat kills me is:  \nAI *is* a tool I use, but it’s not a magic brain that sets up hosting, configures plugins, builds a funnel, writes niche-relevant copy, fixes mobile layout, optimizes speed, adds schema, etc.\n\nThe irony?  \nHe wants to be a *fitness coach* — a job where he expects people to pay him for his expertise instead of “free YouTube workouts.”\n\nI didn’t argue. I just said:  \n“Hey, no worries, sounds like we’re not a good fit. Best of luck.”\n\nBut it really made me think about how weird the freelance landscape is becoming. People want expert-level work, ASAP, stress-free, and basically free… because “AI exists now.”\n\nIt’s not even the $50 offer. It’s the mindset that your skill is worthless because a tool exists.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Just needed to get that out. I’m sure a lot of freelancers are dealing with the same kind of wild expectations lately.",

We'll see when you'll get back to me once you'll hit a wall with hosting / database / connectors / env variables / whatever is out there.  \nEven on a simplest website the coding part is between 30-70% of total effort. Ofc for plumber business website - 4 subpages - it's like 70% maybe because the release and setup is pretty straightforward via. github / gitlab connectors to your fav. static site hosting (i love cloudflare pages).\n\nBut anything more complicated will be either blocked on this stage OR will cost A LOT of money to get through it - as even the 'cheap' website builders such as replit will lock you in behind a paywall to host your website. And once that website hits 5-10k visitors / month - costs will start to ramp up.\n\nI had like 5-6 clients which went back to me from 'my cousin set me a website and then i paid 1k$ per quarter for hosting it because he was an idiot'. No problemo, for 1k$ i can host your static page for your fancy local business forever on CF pages - and even if this would be my own hosting it'd be free for a year for the 1k$ you'll pay me for website.\n\nPPL think ai is easy to be used and do the stuff for you. But it's down to human's knowledge to drive AI towards the result. Same thing with driving a car - once you pass your license you know 'how to manage' the car to be moving. But are you able to drive a lorry? Probably not, as it requires a specific kind of training. \n\nI'm always having a good day tho after talking to ppl impyling that my prices are 'way off' and 'they'll build the website themself'. Yeah. Then after a few weeks i look into such website and i see the 'awesome' results xD and talk back to them with 'do you wonder why your website doesn't work? here's why:' kind of review. \n\ndon't worry bro, just move on and dont' waste time on idiots.",

          "body": "If you’re aiming for something that can realistically reach 10k a year, you need more than tiny gig apps or random tasks. You need a side hustle that builds into an asset or a service people always need.\n\nSelling digital products is one of the easiest ways to get there. You can make planners, templates, journals, or guides using Canva and sell them on Etsy or Gumroad. Once the product is made, it can keep earning without much extra work. A few winners can easily add up to a few hundred a month.\n\nDropshipping on eBay is another solid option. You don’t buy inventory upfront. You list products and when someone buys, a supplier ships it directly. With the help of modern automation tools, most of the heavy lifting is handled for you. A small, steady store can realistically bring in 10k a year.\n\nYou can also make short marketing videos for local businesses. Every business needs simple content for Instagram and TikTok. With stock footage and beginner-friendly tools, you can create these videos quickly. Small businesses often pay monthly for content bundles, so it stacks nicely over time.\n\nIf you want something long term that can keep growing, a faceless YouTube channel is one of the strongest picks. You don’t need to be on camera. You can use simple visuals and modern tools to produce videos efficiently. Once your videos start getting views, you earn from ads, affiliate links, and digital products. A small but steady channel can absolutely reach 10k a year.\n\nAll of these are learnable, beginner friendly, and can grow into something sustainable.\n\nI cover all of these methods in detail on my blog.

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\n https://moolamagnet.com/wealthy-affiliate-the-ultimate-platform-to-start-and-scale-your-affiliate-marketing-business/",

A guy reached out about two months ago saying he was trying to launch a home-cleaning business and was “really strapped for cash.” He sounded sincere, said he was trying to get his first few clients and didn’t want to go into debt.\n\nI normally charge $1,800 for the package he needed. I dropped it to $1,200 because I genuinely wanted to help someone starting out. He thanked me about five times and said the discount made the project possible.\n\nWe’re now halfway through the build, and over the past week I’ve started noticing things that don’t line up with the “barely scraping by” story. He mentioned he’d been busy dealing with a “tenant situation,” and I assumed he meant his landlord. Later he casually clarified he was the landlord. Then yesterday he said he had to move some money around because “one of the rentals needed a new water heater.”\n\nIt threw me off. People who own multiple rentals are not the same people who “can’t possibly justify” paying an extra $600–800 on a website.\n\nI didn’t go digging, but his LLC info is public and his name pulls up two properties in the county records. Nothing crazy rich, but definitely not broke. He’s also driving a much nicer truck than I expected when I met him in person.\n\nNow I’m sitting with that uncomfortable feeling where you realize someone didn’t lie outright, but they definitely leaned hard into a narrative to negotiate a discount. And I fell for it because I try to give new business owners the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI’m not planning to confront him — I already agreed to the price, and the work is fine. But it did make me realize I need to be more firm about discounts and stop assuming every client asking for a break is struggling.\n\nI guess I’m just venting. It sucks when you try to be flexible and it turns out the person didn’t actually need the flexibility. It makes you second-guess your own judgment, and that’s the part that’s bothering me more than the money.",

The stuff that’s actually working going into 2026 is mostly tied to digital assets you can create once and keep selling.\n\nThe most reliable ones I’ve seen are things like building small niche websites that earn through ads/affiliates, creating digital products (templates, guides, printables), learning how to run automated email funnels, or picking up basic video production to make faceless YouTube content. They’re slow at first, but once you understand the systems they can run with minimal day-to-day effort.\n\nThe key is choosing something you’re okay doing consistently for a few months before it pays off. If you want something low-cost and learnable from home, building niche sites + digital products is probably the most beginner-friendly path right now.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

      "selftext": "So for the past 4–5 years, I've been searching for ways to make money both online and in person. I've tried just about everything you can think of: home services, website development, game development, tutoring, dropshipping, affiliate marketing, and a bunch of smaller hustles. By far, the best one I've tried so far is social media.\n\nA lot of people get pissed off that the video they spent hours working on flopped, but that ends up being their biggest mistake. Every social media platform literally shows you *why* your video didn’t perform well. It's right there in the analytics/metrics page. You just have to learn how to read the metrics and what numbers matter for going viral in your niche. Once I learned that, I started going viral with basically every video I made on TikTok.\n\nI found a niche of 2D simulation videos, and I decided to recreate them in 3D using the skills I developed from game development. I grew to 14k followers in my first month. Now I earn $1–3k per month by posting videos that take me about 15 minutes a day to make. (Yeah, it's not fully passive income, but once I post a video, it keeps earning as long as it gets views.)\n\nSo if you’ve read this far, my biggest piece of advice sounds corny, but it’s true: don’t give up so early. Try to learn what you did wrong and how you can improve. If you do that consistently, it would honestly be irrational for you *not* to succeed.",

Though, nothing more than 10$ at max). \n\nNow for YouTube, If you’re serious and can invest some money into it- I am willing to partner with you I can bring in the expertise/topic ideas that can work and you can invest if you find them good enough. For this too I have some serious ideas and will only be willing to discuss it with likeminded individuals. \n\nNow, for those who were looking for proofs of my earnings, I am attaching them here (Obviously some personal details are hidden but you can see the names and earnings) — https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11bWCxdt9SIwsz21WzFe-6gyJ9PRD5EUV \n\nPls Note: I have almost replied to everyone who reached out to me, commented back to everyone who wanted to know certain things. I have learned a lot from this sub and just want to give back. If you think I am a scammer, no problem, pls stay away from me and don’t get scammed. But if you believe you can turn your life a little bit better just like me, reach out. If you want to do facebook, DM me “Interested in facebook” if you want to do YouTube, DM me “Youtube Partnership”. \n",

I started uploading game mods to [Modsfire](https://modsfire.com/?rf=130427). This service pays for each download with money generated by ads shown when downloading the files. They host your files and both of you get money. Rates are variable by country, but 1000 downloads from the US are worth 13$. I mainly try to get traffic from there, but I also get it from all around the world which pays a lot less, but cents add up.\n\nWanted to share here because almost everyone on reddit knows about some game that has mods.\n\nThis may be your first Internet passive money, take the opportunity if you can.",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

      "selftext": "Right now there's insane competition between companies trying to acquire new users. Banks, apps, games, brokerages... they all have massive marketing budgets and sometimes they compete so aggressively that the signup bonuses end up being worth more than any cost or requirement to get them. You're basically just exploiting companies overpaying for customer acquisition.\n\nSome examples of what I did last month: one brokerage paid me $75 just to deposit $25 (which I kept). A bank paid $350 for setting up a single direct deposit. And there are mobile games where you buy an in-game pack for $10 and get paid $13 back. Sounds fake but it's a real thing.\n\nThis probably won't make you rich but it's been an easy extra few hundred each month which has helped with my grocery bill. The tricky part is really just finding these offers before everyone else flocks to them and they get capped or expire.\n\nI got tired of hunting for them manually so I built a site to track everything. It's at [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) if anyone wants to check it out. Fair warning there are referral links but all the info is free.\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

They get generic, robotic outputs because they use generic inputs.\n\nI spent the last few months reverse-engineering how top agencies and automated channels actually use AI.

I’m sharing 3 of the most useful ones here so you can stop wasting time on bad outputs.\n\n# 1. The \"Objection Crusher\" (For Sales &amp; Negotiation)\n\n*Use this when a client or customer is giving you a hard time. It uses the \"Feel, Felt, Found\" psychological framework.*\n\n    TASK: Identify the top 5 objections a cynical buyer would have about [PRODUCT].\n    \n    EXECUTION: Write a \"FAQ\" section where you ruthlessly destroy these objections.\n    - Method: \"Feel, Felt, Found\" (Empathy -&gt; Bridge -&gt; Proof).\n    - Tone: Empathetic but firm.\n    - Format: Q: [Objection] A: [Response].\n    \n    [PRODUCT] = \"Your Product Here\"\n\n# 2. The \"Deep Dive\" Persona (For Marketing)\n\n*Stop guessing who your customer is. This prompt builds a psychographic profile better than most marketing agencies.*\n\n    TASK: Create a detailed User Persona for [PRODUCT].\n    \n    PROFILE:\n    1. Demographics: Age, income, location.\n    2. Psychographics: Fears, desires, secret vices.\n    3. A Day in the Life: Walk through their morning to night.\n    4. Where they hang out: Specific Subreddits, YouTube channels, Newsletters.\n    \n    [PRODUCT] = \"Your Product Here\"\n\n# 3. The \"Ghost Creator\" (For Content)\n\n*If you need viral scripts that don't sound like AI wrote them.*\n\n    ROLE: Act as a Viral Content Scriptwriter. You are an expert in narrative pacing and \"retention engineering.\"\n    \n    INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. The Hook (0-3 seconds): Create a 'Pattern Interrupt' hook. Do not start with \"Here is a story...\" Start in media res.\n    2. The Body: Use short, punchy sentences (max 12 words). Every 3rd sentence must introduce a new piece of info.\n    3. The CTA: End with a polarizing question.\n    \n    [TOPIC] = \"Your Topic Here\"\n\n**Why am I sharing this?** Because efficient prompting is the only skill that matters right now.\n\nI compiled my full list of 50 engineer-level prompts (including the \"Copywriting Assassin\" and \"Infinite Product\" frameworks) into a document called **The Phantom Protocol**.\n\nComment if you want to see the full list.\n\nHope this helps you hack the matrix.",

      "selftext": "Started doing finance TikTok in February because everyone kept saying you can make money from it. I work at a bank doing loan stuff and figured I know enough about credit to post about it.\n\nCouldn't show my face though. Someone at our branch posted about mortgage rates on LinkedIn last year and got called into HR. It was generic advice but they freaked out. So yeah not doing that.\n\nFirst few months was just text over stock footage. Got like 180 views per video. Took forever to edit too. Tried filming my hands instead. Better but people kept commenting asking why I'm hiding.\n\nWas stuck at 600 followers in May for like 5 weeks. I was putting in 6 or 7 hours a week and nobody was watching. Stopped posting for two weeks because it felt pointless.\n\nPosted something in June about credit card payments and my chin was in the frame because I angled my phone wrong. That got 15k views. Everything else was under 1k.\n\nSo faces matter but I can't use mine. Tried some stuff in August. Nothing worked. Started using generated faces in September. CapCut for editing, APOB for the face thing, Descript for audio. Like $28 a month.\n\nViews went back up. Some videos get 2k, some get 8k. Had two hit over 15k in November. At 3200 followers now.\n\nCreator Fund was $38 in October. November was $118 because of those bigger videos. December is like $48 so far.\n\nBudgeting app reached out in November. $120 for two videos. Made them, got paid. They wanted more but I checked their reviews and it was 2.3 stars with people saying it charged them twice. Passed on that.\n\nCrypto company offered $180 for one video. Googled them and they got sued last year. Almost promoted a scam which would've been bad.\n\nSomeone DMed me two weeks ago saying my credit utilization video helped them go from 640 to 695 in four months. That felt better than the money honestly. Which sounds cheesy but whatever.\n\nTakes maybe 5 hours a week now. Writing scripts takes longest because I want it to be accurate. So many finance TikToks have wrong information.\n\nLast month was $238 total. This month probably under $85. Super inconsistent.\n\nFeels weird using a fake face. But everything else is real. My voice, research, scripts. Just not the face. Can't show mine without work issues and faceless content doesn't work.\n\nDon't know how to make this stable. Do I just keep posting and hope stuff hits? Try to figure out what goes viral? Post on other platforms? Idk.\n\nThe anonymous part works for what I need. Can talk about bank stuff without my manager seeing. But stuck at this income level where it's not enough to justify the time unless it grows.\n\nAnyone doing content where you can't show your face? How'd you get past the income being all over the place?",

          "body": "This is actually solid progress for someone who started faceless and has work restrictions. Most people never get past a few hundred followers because they give up long before they hit the point where something finally works. You kept experimenting and you have a system now that brings consistent views even if the income swings month to month.\n\nThe fake face thing is not a problem. Loads of creators use avatars or generated faces because of jobs or privacy. The part that matters is your voice and the accuracy of your info. People can feel when someone actually knows what they are talking about and that is why your stuff is getting shared.\n\nThe money being unstable is normal on TikTok. If you want it to become stable you need to use TikTok as the top of the funnel and build something you own underneath it. That is where the predictable income comes from. Most faceless creators who make real money do something like:\n\nPost short videos regularly Build an email list or small community Link to something they control A digital product service or newsletter Long term that is what smooths the income\n\nYou already have the hardest part which is content that people trust. You can repurpose everything you make onto Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts with almost no extra work. Some creators get five times the reach just by posting the same clip in different places.\n\nYou are further ahead than you think. If you keep posting weekly and start building something you own in the background, you can turn the unpredictable income into something steady. The skill of making finance content that people understand is worth a lot more than one month of TikTok payouts.",

If you want to make more off that one asset you will have to start doing non passive things like updating your asset and promoting it etc. not worth it IMO.\n\nBut I think if you do your market research first you could find a niche and make an asset in 1-2 weeks and expect $20-50 a year in return.

Some things needed daily work, some could sit for a week or a month, but nothing was “set it once and forget it”.\n\nRight now the only thing that brings in steady money is a small dropshipping style setup targeting India. It is not huge, but it pays better than anything else I tried. Even so, it still needs at least an hour a day for ads, customer emails, small changes on the site and testing new products. When I first set it up I used a few tools to speed things up for the store page itself, including a one line website builder like genstore to get a basic store online, then I went back and fixed the details by hand. That part was “easy”, but keeping it running is not.\n\nSo at this point I see “passive income” more as income that does not need you full time, but still needs real attention. I am curious how other people here define it.",

Even the stuff that does make money still needs you checking in, fixing things, updating pages, replying to people, whatever. For me, passive income just means something that doesn’t require full-time hours, not something you set up once and never touch again. If anything, the only thing that feels close is investing, because once the money is in an index fund or Bitcoin, it grows without me doing anything. But all the online side hustles still need you to show up.",

          "body": "\"Passive income\" is really more accurately \"semi-passive income\" for most people. The YouTube fantasy of \"set and forget\" systems rarely exists at scale. What you're experiencing is the reality - successful income streams require ongoing maintenance and optimization.\n\nEven traditionally passive investments like dividend stocks, REITs, or bonds require research and portfolio adjustments. The key difference is the decoupling of time-for-money that happens in traditional employment.\n\nYour dropshipping business sounds like it's in that sweet spot - not completely hands-off, but with better time leverage than a 9-5. That's a win! The goal should be building systems where your hourly \"maintenance\" return exceeds what you'd make in direct employment, not eliminating work entirely.",

Is the market over-saturated already? Don't waste time on something people don't need.\n- now you've found a problem, fixed it, created the product etc. But what if people can't find your product? You need SEO, make sure your product is discoverable. \n- niche and specific; specific industry, specific problem + solution.

Affiliate sales is a great long game way to make money and can virtually get started right away with platforms like amazon associates, shopify collabs or mavely but it will be small at first and the more you share, the more it will compound and become passive income. Another long game option that can be really fun is starting a YouTube channel about things you are truly passionate about. With consistency of posting 1 video per week I’ve seen many creators get monetized in 3-6 months. Those are two of my fave as a person who has 6 online income streams. Hope this helps!",

The idea is you choose a specific niche and you surround all your activities around that chosen niche. \n\nBut how to begin? You might want to consider using a platform I myself use. It has everything you need under one roof start and grow your business including wehosting up to 10 websites, AI tools to help you choose the perfect niche and to create your content. AI tool to also provide you with countless products to promote along with this and to get your links all automatically. Best of all includes comprehensive training from beginner to expert classes and a huge community of successful marketers willing to help out with any questions 24/7. You can test drive it completely free, and they are right now running an amazing Black Friday special. At the end of this post I have a link to a review about it if you care to take a look.\n\n\nThis is what I recommend (my blueprint for success):\n\n1) start and grow an affiliate marketing website. Over time you become the authority in your niche. Once you have around 15 to 30 posts you should then add in some affiliate links to products you will promote related to your niche.\n\n2) once going consider starting a you tube channel where you can eventually monetize through you tube. But before you even reach the minimum to get monetize you can still earn money by adding affiliate links to related products in your video descriptions.\n\n3) once number 1) is going and you have some traffic to your website create a course and ebook on a topic in your niche. Start an email list on your website and once you get some subscribers you can market your ebook and course. \n\nAll of this is without paid advertising but you can use advertising as well.\n\nThe benefit to the above versus things like surveys, etc, is that you are building a business overtime that you own and no one can take away from you. \n\nThis sounds like something that might fit what you are looking for. You build your online business slowly at your own pace during your free time.\n\nIf you would like a great resource that includes training and all the tools you will need to do the above take a look at the following review I wrote. Disclaimer: you sign up for a completely free starter membership (never ends and no credit card required) to try out the program so you can actually see that this works for you! And if you like it the cost to upgrade is minimal considering you will have all the tools to succeed under one roof, including web hosting, AI tools to help you choose the best niche and to help you write blog posts, comprehensive training on all aspects of affiliate marketing, including automatic AI generated lists of high profitable products related to your niche that you can promote,and a community of like minded individuals eager to help you at anytime of the day!\n\nWishing you much success!\n\nhttps://moolamagnet.com/is-the-wealthy-affiliate-black-friday-deal-worth-it-heres-whats-included-november-28-december-1/",

Use Canva to create planners, journals, templates, or simple guides and sell them on Etsy or Gumroad. You make the product once and it can keep earning in the background. It’s beginner friendly and a good first step into online income.\n\nYou can also build a faceless YouTube channel. You don’t need to show your face or record your own voice. Use simple visuals, stock clips, and AI voice tools to produce clean videos. Once a few videos start getting views, you can earn from ads, affiliate links, and small digital products. It takes work at the beginning, but it can pay long after the video is uploaded.\n\nIf you like the idea of offering services, you can learn voiceover work. With modern tools, making high quality voiceovers is much easier than before, and people use them for videos, ads, and short content. You can get started quickly and build a portfolio from home.\n\nAnother option is dropshipping. You don’t need inventory. You list items, and when someone buys, a supplier ships it. With automation tools, a lot of the process becomes easier, so you can run it in your spare time without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAll of these are legitimate, beginner friendly, and learnable from home.\n\nI cover all of these methods step by step on my blog.

(make money and dating = harder, health and parenting = easier)\n\nGoogle/YouTube:\n- search \"[niche] + problem\"\n- are people creating content?\n- high search volume = high buyer intent\n\nReddit:\n- are there active subreddits?\n- are people asking for solutions?\n- can you post without instant bans? (check subreddit rules)\n\nNative Ads (Taboola/Outbrain):\n- do fear/curiosity headlines work in this niche?\n- health, finance, survival = native ad goldmines\n\nif you can't find clear traffic sources, kill that vertical. doesn't matter how good the offer is if you can't get eyeballs.\n\nstep 3: match problems to existing offers (10 minutes)\n\ndon't create products. find problems people are already paying to solve, then find offers that solve them.\n\ngo where your potential buyers are:\n- Facebook groups\n- Reddit threads  \n- YouTube comments\n- Amazon reviews of competing products\n\nlook for repeated complaints:\n- \"I've tried everything and nothing works\"\n- \"I don't know where to start\"\n- \"this is too complicated\"\n- \"I need this to work fast\"\n\nthese are buying signals disguised as frustration.\n\nnow go back to ClickBank/MaxWe, use ChatGPT or  google to find offers. find offers that directly address these exact complaints.\n\nexample:\n- complaint: \"I can't stick to meal plans, they're too complicated\"\n- offer: \"5-Minute Keto Meal Plans For Busy Moms\" ($120 commission)\n\nthe offer already exists. the buyers already exist. you're just the bridge.\n\n\nThe 48-hour validation test for affiliates\n\nmost affiliates waste months building \"content strategies\" before promoting anything.\n\nfuck that. test offers immediately.\n\nvalidation test structure:\n\nDay 1: Build Your Test Funnel\n\n- create simple pre-lander on Carrd ($19/year) or ClickFunnels (free trial)\n- headline: call out the exact pain you found in Step 3\n- 2-3 paragraphs agitating the problem\n- CTA button to affiliate offer\n\ntotal time: 2 hours max\n\nDay 2: Drive 100-200 Clicks\n\n- Facebook group posts (if allowed)\n- Reddit comments with value + link\n- Instagram story swipe-ups (if you have 10k followers)\n- $50 Facebook ad test\n- $50 native ad test\n\ntrack everything:\n- clicks to pre-lander\n- clicks to offer  \n- conversions\n\nWhat Validates:\n\n- 5%+ CTR from pre-lander to offer = strong pain-to-solution match\n- 1+ conversion in 200 clicks = offer converts, scale traffic\n- 0 conversions but 10%+ CTR = offer is weak, test different offer\n- 0 conversions, low CTR = pain angle is off, rewrite pre-lander\n\nif you get a conversion in your first $100 spend, you found a winner. pour gas on it.\n\nif you don't, you learned what doesn't work in 48 hours instead of 3 months. kill it and test the next vertical.\n\n\nPick your niche based on data, not feelings\n\nafter testing 2-3 verticals, choose the one where:\n\n1. offers convert(you got sales or strong CTR to offer)\n2. traffic is accessible(you can drive 500+ clicks/day without breaking the bank)\n3. commissions are worth it ($80+ per conversion minimum)\n\nthat's your niche. not because you love it. because the data says buyers exist and offers convert.\n\n-you don't need to be passionate about weight loss to promote weight loss offers.\n\n-you don't need to care about golf to drive traffic to golf training programs.\n\n-you need to drive traffic, generate conversions, and collect commissions.\n\nAvoid these affiliate niche traps\n\n-trap 1: picking niches with no proven offers\n\n if ClickBank has zero offers in your niche with 30+ gravity, move on\nno existing affiliates making money = you're pioneering, not profiting\n\n-trap 2: choosing niches where traffic is expensive/banned\n\ncrypto, CBD, adult = higher conversions but constant ad account bans.\nunless you have experience, start with easier traffic (health, parenting, hobbies).\n\n-trap 3: promoting offers that pay less than $50/conversion\n\n low commissions mean you need massive volume to profit.\n$10 per sale on a 2% conversion rate = you need 1,000 clicks for $20.\n$150 per sale on a 2% conversion rate = you need 100 clicks for $300.\n\n-trap 4: waiting to \"build authority\" before promoting\n\n you're not a content creator, you're a trafficker\nrun ads, test offers, collect data—authority is irrelevant\n\n-trap 5: switching niches every week\n\ncommit to one vertical for 30 days minimum.\ntest 5+ offers, 10+ traffic sources, 20+ angles.\nmost affiliates quit right before they find the winning combo.\n\nThe 30-Day Commit: What Actually Happens\n\nyou're not \"building a niche\" for months. you're testing aggressively for 30 days to find what prints money.\n\nweek 1: rapid testing\n\n- test 3 offers in your chosen vertical\n- drive 200 clicks to each ($150-$300 total spend)\n- find which offer converts best\n\nweek 2: angle testing\n\n- take winning offer, test 5 different pain angles\n- same offer, different messaging\n- find which angle gets highest CTR + conversions\n\nweek 3: traffic scaling\n\n- take winning offer + winning angle\n- test 3 traffic sources (Facebook, native ads, YouTube)\n- find which source is profitable\n\nweek 4: scale profitable combos\n\n- double down on: winning offer + winning angle + winning traffic source\n- kill everything else\n- optimize for EPC and conversion rate\n\nby day 30, you know:\n\n- which offers convert for you\n- which pain angles resonate  \n- which traffic sources are profitable\n- what your EPC and conversion rates are\n\nmost affiliates never get here because they never committed to 30 days of actual execution.\n\naffiliate partner who followed this exact process (September 2024):\n\nday 1-7: tested 3 ClickBank offers in survival/prepping niche\n \nday 8-14: found winner (emergency food storage program, $180 commission), tested 5 angles  \n\nday 15-21:winning angle = \"food shortage fear,\" tested Facebook + native ads  \n\nday 22-30: scaled native ads to $300/day spend\n\nresults after 30 days:\n\n$6,840 in commissions | $2,100 ad spend | 38 sales | 4.2% conversion rate | $3.26 EPC\n\nhe didn't know shit about survival. he just found where money was flowing and got in the way.\n\nStart Today:\n\nstep 1: pick vertical (today)\n\n- go to ClickBank, sort by gravity\n- choose vertical with 10+ offers above 50 gravity\n- commit for 30 days, no switching\n\nstep 2: find 3 offers to test (today)\n\n- filter by commission $80+\n- read sales pages, find best converting hooks\n- grab affiliate links\n\nstep 3: build test pre-lander (today)\n\n- Carrd or ClickFunnels\n- headline = main pain point\n- 3 paragraphs agitating pain\n- CTA to offer\n\nstep 4: drive first 200 clicks (days 1-2)\n\n- $50 Facebook ad test\n- $50 native ad test\n- free: Reddit + Facebook group posts\n\nstep 5: analyze data (day 3)\n\n- any conversions? scale that offer\n- high CTR, no conversions? test different offer\n- low CTR? rewrite pre-lander\n\n",

And a wild 12 months it has been. \n\nMy initial insight when starting the tool site was two-fold:\n\n1. I found many tool sites, like Omni Calculator, getting millions of views every month. While many of them benefit from years of acquiring backlinks for free due to ranking highly, I figured that over time there'd be enough opportunities to catch up.\n\n2. I knew from my old blogging days that making money via display ads could be very lucrative, even though tool sites normally get lower RPMs (cause people don't scroll as much and just use the tool). \n\nWhen I first started terrific tools, the goal was to monetize it via a file converter app as well as those above-mentioned display ads. \n\nAnd November 2025 was the first full month where I just did that. \n\nSo how did the site do?\n\nIt made $174.41 from Mediavine/PubNation display ads and $125 from the sale of the desktop app, so close to $300. Not too shabby! \n\nAds started out a little disappointing as I was just onboarded to Mediavine. However, in the last week or so, I've gotten closer to my target session RPM of $10 (December's session RPM so far is $6.89). \n\nStill some way to go but at least, assuming traffic demographics remain consistent, there's a pathway to $10 RPM.\n\nTraffic-wise, not much has changed unfortunately. Last 30d traffic is at 26k users, 34k sessions, and 41k page views. \n\nSeems as if right now I am being targeted by some bot traffic because China and Singapore entered my top 5 highest traffic countries. \n\nAll of that said, I haven't released any new tools for the main site in a while since our startup (https://genviral.io/, feel free to check) is currently taking up 99% of my time. Made a few improvements to the desktop app, mainly for myself, as I needed those conversions. \n\nFor now, I'll probably just use the profits from terrific tools and invest it into backlinks and YouTube sponsorships (once the desktop app is a bit more mature). \n\nI always maintained that this could be a $10k/m project down the line. However, for that to be a reality, I need to significantly increase current traffic, probably by 20x-30x. \n\nAnd since this was always a long-term (&gt; 5 years) play, I'm prepared to be patient.. :)",

Half the time, it is just bots skewing the picture, and it throws off any sense of what is actually working. The long term view you have feels right, though. Tool pages can take forever to settle into stable rankings, especially when each one behaves like its own little ecosystem. When you get back to building more tools, it might help to look at how users actually move through the ones you already have. Sometimes a small internal link tweak ends up doing more than a big push for backlinks. Curious if you have noticed which tools hold people the longest.",

      "selftext": "I started my first business in 2010, and have gone from having about a thousand bucks in my bank account to a paper net worth in the low nine figures (though this will come down to high eight figures after taxes). Here's my advice FWIW:\n\n**1. Learn technical skills.** Unless you're an artist or a restauranteur or something like that, odds are that the majority of your work is going to be done on a computer. As such, you should master keyboard shortcuts, use multiple monitors, set up your workspace in an efficient way, learn basic coding skills (Javascript, HTML, and SQL are all you really need), know how to model things out in spreadsheets, etc. These skills have been instrumental to me in everything I've done as an entrepreneur, and without them there is absolutely no way I would have succeeded. One of my earliest memories of my first business was a friend asking me how I was making money (he was trying something similar and failing); I could see that a lot of the reason he was failing is that he couldn't handle any of the technical aspects of what he was doing himself (eg building a website), and so was paying for someone else do do a third-rate job of it. I said \"learn how to code\" and he responded with \"but that's too hard.\" Yes, learning new things is hard, and he also should have learned how to code. Which brings me to...\n\n**2. Suck it up and do the hard things.** The vast majority of people give up when they hit their first wall. Another huge chunk drop off after the second, third, or fourth. The people who succeed are the ones who suck it up and power through the shitty parts of entrepreneurship (and it's mostly shitty at the start). I learned this during the first year of my third business, and I'm learning it again now as I'm trying to get my philanthropic efforts off the ground: there is just so much stuff when you're starting out that's a pain in the ass, and there's no one to do it but you. If you can muster the mental fortitude to just make yourself do those things, you will separate yourself from 99% of the competition and massively increase your odds of success. As just one example: can you even *imagine* how difficult it must have been to sell books on the internet in 1993? Jeff Bezos must have literally run into thousands of pain-in-the-ass things, any one of which would have deterred a normal person, but he kept at it and now he's Jeff Bezos.\n\n**3. That which gets measured gets improved.** I have kept a side scrolling daily spreadsheet of my company's P&amp;L every single day going back to 2010. If I determine that something is critical to my company's success, I carefully measure it over time, and take note of any initiative that moves the numbers in a positive or negative direction. Even if you're just starting out and there's not much to measure, measure it. Make it a habit. While it's possible to drown yourself in data overload, I think it's much more common for people to be deficient in their data gathering and analysis than to take it too far.\n\n**4. Practice good manners.** It's crazy to have to write this one out, but I can't tell you how many people I come across that don't do this. If someone emails you, respond quickly. If they help you, say thank you (in fact, I recommend signing off on all your emails with \"Thanks, \\[First Name\\]\"). If they ask for a favor that's easy for you to deliver, do the favor. Follow up with people after a good conversation. Remember to always speak to what the *other person* wants, not just what you want. (That's another head-scratcher: the number of people who will say \"Hey Chris, it would really help me if you do X and Y\" without even considering what I want or whether it's in my interest to do what they're asking.)\n\n**5. Be obsessed with your business.** I recently stepped away from my company and handed the reins over to the management team. One of the major differences I've noticed in how they do things vs how I did things is that I was *obsessed* with the business, and they're not (somewhat understandably, obviously, as they don't have my equity stake in it). When you're obsessed with your business, things don't catch you by surprise because you were already worried about them way before they happened. When you're obsessed with your business, you always have a dozen ideas ready to go whenever resources free up. When you're obsessed with your business, you become the ultimate expert at the company across a variety of topics, and can be an invaluable resource to employees / teammates. Get obsessed.",

It really boils down to going from \"Execute ASAP\" to \"Medium term strategy and operations\".\n\nIf could add a point to your list - I would expand around \"Build a Process-Oriented Business\". Meaning that you are only as good as your documentation and processes for long-term scalability.\n\nIt's easy to know how to do most everything yourself at first (cause you built it), but building a process allows you to more easily slot in hires and make sure that the business can operate without you needing to be involved in every step.",

Finally tapped out and decided to coach other crazies instead of going for another loop. \n\nJust remember, the irrational optimism that causes you to start a company is also the thing that can cause you to ignore the biggest issues with your company. Hope is not a valid business strategy. \n\nGood luck!",

I'm not a huge fan of Universities today but there's a handful of geniuses in the field of business who practice what preach and preach because they practiced. Some of the online personas are helpful like Hormozi, Gary Vee, but still a lot of what they do is to keep engagements for their own brands and/or sell things. I'd start reading books by genius professors, I'm bias, because that and value investment books are largely the only things I've read but it provided me deep insight into utilizing my endless idea generation, in refining and testing ideas, choosing the \"all-in\" and eventually seeing everything through in the real order things need to be done in.\n\nFor example: you could write a decent business plan, do tons of research on competitors, build a prototype, start networking with investors, start looking for team members &amp; the list goes on. Without a framework for focus and prioritization your business can easily become a mess, regardless of your plan. I'd check out Nathan Furr's books Nail it then Scale it or Innovators Method. If you want to create better ideas/businesses, I'd suggest something like innovators solution by Clayton Christensen, although the ideas are complex and he's heavy on business terminology (hard read but very valuable).\n\nI read a book weekly now to ensure I'm always learning and staying intellectually honest.",

That alone makes the U.S. an over saturated services market in one way. \n\nGo to another country that’s better balanced and maybe the services would sell better? \n\nJust an example of thinking more about supply and demand. \n\nI think the key is so many people choose something that’s not really needed and then have to work like hell to sell it. \n\nAt the beginning it won’t be easy, but if you’re getting the word out and nobody wants it, your product might not be the right thing for your market.",

Example from last week: Guy DMs me: \"I need HubSpot set up, what do you charge?\" Me: \"Before we talk price - do you have 5-10 hours over the next month? and your team is 1-2 with 500&gt;leads\" Him: \"Uh, probably? Why?\" Me: \"Because if you do, you should DIY it. HubSpot Academy is free, YouTube has everything, you'll learn more doing it yourself.\" Him: \"Wait, you're a consultant telling me not to hire you?\" Me: \"Yeah. You seem technically capable. You'll spend 5-10 hours either way - doing it yourself or explaining your business to me. Might as well learn the system.\" He hired me anyway. Said the honesty made him trust me more. My partner: \"Stop doing that. You're leaving money on the table.\" Me: \"I'm building trust faster than I'm losing revenue.\" But honestly? I don't know if this is smart or stupid. On one hand: I've closed 2 clients in 2 months using this approach. Both specifically said \"I hired you because you told me when NOT to hire you.\" On the other hand: I've probably talked 10+ people out of paying me because I was only honest with them. That's potentially lost revenue. Am I building a sustainable business or just being naive for saying the truth that actually helps? Looking for honest feedback from people who've actually built service businesses. what do you recommend do I stop being honest?",

I'm a professional photographer and I specialize in senior(high school) portraits. We average $1500+ per session. Their parents are the ones paying. But, because we advertise \"senior portraits\", I get college seniors reaching out for sessions. In these situations, they are the ones paying. College seniors have 20+ student photographers at their school, offering the same service for $150. While we would do an amazing job, we're not the right fit for them and I would feel as though I'm drastically overcharging them for a service that they can get for next to nothing on their campus.\n\nBut, I also know that they only want to spend about $150 and I'm not going to provide that service at that price point when my time is better spent with clients that will invest $1500+.\n\nI could agree with you path if by turning down this business, you're capturing other clients who spend 10x on another service.

You telling them how easy it is or telling them how many hours it takes is not honesty, it’s nonprofit work. If you want to do that, start a nonprofit that teaches people for free or offer free courses online. Sell your service, charge a reasonable price and offer unmatched value and education with the service. \n\n2) I bet most of them probably start, get frustrated and hire someone else who will not lead them away from what they wanted in the first place. It is shortsighted for an owner to spend time on remedial tasks to save a few dollars. I’ve learned that lesson the hard way in business. You’re probably hurting them even more adding more to their plates instead of letting them focus on growing their businesses. Smart owners deploy resources for tasks they should not be doing. Now learning how it works after the setup is vital and where you come in. \n\n3) As someone who also loves to empower people as well, know you cannot hurt your business by doing so. If a client isn’t a good fit or can’t afford your service, that’s when you can spend a few minutes empowering them to DIY. That’s what we call goodwill.

The effectiveness depends on one variable that you did not mention: your price point.\n\nIf you charge marginal fees, telling people to DIY kills revenue because the difference between paying you and spending a few hours themselves is small. They will happily pay to avoid the hassle, so you are pushing away viable buyers.\n\nIf you charge $10,000 plus, your approach is correct. It filters out anyone who cannot afford you, saves you from low-value delivery, and establishes immediate trust with the buyers who actually matter. High-ticket service work requires ruthless qualification. A client who hesitates at 5 to 10 hours of DIY time will absolutely hesitate at five figures of consulting. They would drain time, attention, and margin.\n\nIf you are in the higher bracket, keep doing it. You are positioning yourself as the strategist who tells the truth, not the freelancer who grabs every dollar. That signals confidence, competence, and selectivity. Buyers notice that. Your close rate will remain lower, but your margin, fit, and long-term value will increase.\n\nIf your price is low, stop doing it. The economics do not support the filter.\n\nSo the real question is simple: what do you charge, and what is your target buyer’s profile? The rest flows from that.",

          "body": "Many people think running ads will solve their problem. But ads only amplify what’s working (or not working) so if you run ads to an offer where the offer isn’t clear and isn’t working organically it won’t work whether you get 100 views or 100millioj views.\n\nThis ad is offering something to do with sales but the promise is not desirable. It says: win contacts on merit. \n\nNo one sits there saying I wish I could win sales on merit. They say - I hate selling, it’s hard. They say no one buys. I don’t know how to handle objections. I don’t know how to sell. I don’t know why people aren’t buying. I need someone to tell me what to say. Etc. And the language they use will be very different depending on whether they are new to selling or seasoned sellers looking to up their game. \n\nYour offer isn’t clear. I don’t know who it’s for. I don’t know what you’re solving (sales sure but what exactly and how?) your hook is not strong. And the comic doesn’t make it clear what I’m getting if I click.\n\nSo for example: Therapists: struggling to get people to say yes to working with you on your sales calls? Only booking 1 session at a time and then have to keep reselling them? Check out the simple 2step method that’s helped hundreds of therapists book out their practice and sell 6month therapy packages without cringey sales scripts or pushy tactics. \n\nOkay so I made that up completely but I want you to see: \n1. I know who I’m helping - not everyone struggling with sales - I’m helping therapists.\n2. I understand their deeper problem - people get on an intro call and don’t want to commit to more than 1 session at a time. It’s frustrating having to keep reselling and they can’t really get people results in 1 session. \n3. I understand their problem with sales - they don’t want to feel salesy or pushy or learn scripts.\n4. I have a simple two step framework to make selling easy.\n5. I have a clear result - they’ll be able to sell 6 month packages easily. \n\nNow as long as I can actually fulfil that promise and get them real results that will get clicks. But what will make it a successful business will be testimonials and word or mouth and referrals as I become known as the person who helps therapists make sales. \n\nSo if you’re genuinely wanting to help people make sales:\n\n1. Find a niche group of people who are struggling. \n2. Work with them for free (I worked with my first clients free for three months)\n3. Get them results - figure out where they’re getting stuck, what they really need etc and get them results.\n4. They will become your biggest fans and be happy to share testimonials and results and some will even want to continue working with you - paid. (Thats how I got my first paying clients)\n5. Then go and offer more people those results - you will now have a clear niche and clear promise and clear results so selling becomes easier. And you do it discounted 50% off kind of thing. You see many people do founders launches etc for this kind of thing. Get 10 more people. Get them results. Now your testimonials are growing. \n6. Now you can start selling at full price and start scaling. \n\nThat’s how I built my business coaching practice and it’s how I’m busy building my second business which is my accounting practice while still running my coaching business. \n\nIt always sucks when you try something and don’t get the results you wanted. But the key is you were brave enough to try. You clearly want to be successful in your business and you’re asking for feedback. So go and learn everything you can about making a good offer and then try again. \n\nAll the best!",

It sounds like you've already cracked the code on getting attention with your creative, which is the harder part. The leak in the funnel is likely at the moment someone clicks through.

Your landing page needs to instantly build the trust your ad can't.\n\nInstead of pouring more budget into top-of-funnel ads, a powerful pivot would be to invest in building that unshakeable social proof first. This means a dedicated strategy for gathering genuine, high-quality reviews. It’s a foundational marketing asset that makes every subsequent ad dollar work harder. For a service that specializes in this exact process, you could look into StarBrite. They are a review and referral gathering company located in Provo, UT. Their model focuses on human connection to secure authentic testimonials. Having a base of strong, credible reviews transforms a landing page from a sales pitch into a validated destination, which could dramatically improve the conversion rate of any future traffic you drive.",

Genuinely helpful comments (like this one, i hope). Show up in threads where I can actually add value. No links, no pitch; just help. Over time, people click your profile, see what you're building.\n\n2. Build in public on Twitter. Share what I'm shipping daily. Way more effective than ads because it builds trust and audience simultaneously.\n\n3. SEO content. Blog posts targeting terms my audience actually searches for. Takes time to compound, but free traffic forever once it ranks.\n\n4. Communities. Discord servers, Slack groups, Reddit communities, wherever your target customers hang out. Engage authentically. Answer questions. Help people.\n\nThe math on organic: 20 min/day of helpful Reddit comments, 30 min drafting tweets, 15 min engaging. That's \\~1 hour/day of marketing that compounds over months.\n\n$1,000 of ads that burned in a few weeks vs. 1 hour/day that builds an audience, reputation, and relationships.\n\nObviously this doesn't scale the same way paid can when it works, but for indie hackers and early-stage founders, organic usually wins.\n\nWhat's the product?

In my experience, Reddit users click because the creative is interesting, not because they’re ready to buy. If the landing page doesn’t continue the exact promise, tone, or curiosity from the ad, bounce rates hit 90 percent and conversions flatline. High curiosity + low intent is a common pattern in this channel.\n\nAcross campaigns I’ve seen, the biggest determinant of Reddit performance is how well the first 5 seconds of the landing page answer the question: “Why am I here?” When that alignment is tight, CTR stays high but bounce rate drops and deeper clicks appear. When it’s off, the ads feel entertaining but not motivating.\n\nA practical step is to test a version of the landing page that mirrors the exact hook, visual style, and copy angle of your best-performing ad.

I’m also polishing a second app to handle the social media side, while flowjoy handles the search/text side\n\nMy Plan Moving Forward:\n\nStop crying about being 25 and got nothing to show for it\n\nuse my own tool to handle the SEO/Reddit grunt work.\n\nlaunch the my second app to handle instagram/youtube/tiktok.\n\nget on camera and document this messy journey.\n\nThis life feels like a rollercoaster and i don't know if it's just me or is it like this for everyone",

It can completely, absolutely change your life. I mean it. Especially someone that's competent in what they do. \n\nFind someone that does marketing while you take care of the tech and some business side. Two cofounders often make a far stronger case when it comes to networking (which you need lots of times), and it's generally a far better workflow than being solo. Solo is doable but ive only seen it done by people who are truly a spark in the dark. Two is often much better, also just because of the workload. \n\nFocus on doing your things right each and you might actually get things going well. \n\nSeparately, if you can't get a quality cofounder (better someone with quality than someone that is clueless and will just take away more years or months...) then try working with a startup even if you're not paid that much to start but make sure they have grit and can get things going. This is so you can build experience in the startup scene. Takes away a lot of the imagination as well. Then whenn you go find your cofounder make sure they've also been similarly involved. Either cofounded something successful or something alike. You might even consider working with someone significantly older if that's the case. Younger successful founders are way harder to come by and will likely only jump on your boat if you're something like them. So just get started with the rigjt people first. A company isn't 1 person. Gotta start somewhere. \n\nMy 2 cents good luck stay positive",

My most recent mobile apps (that I developed in the late 2010s) used Machine Learning and Augmented Reality and they still failed for the most part.  I figured if I can't make a profit using the most cutting edge technologies, I might as well move on to another industry.  I used to make a decent profit in the early 2010s, but at this point it's become impossible.  Or if an app is successful, it's usually only very briefly and then the revenue stops.  So I've been developing a video game for almost 6 years now, and hope to release it by the end of next year.  And hope to release it for many many platforms at a high price, and that should do the trick.  And you're right about marketing, after I release this video game I'm going to spend the next year marketing it.",

Fail forward. \n\nI remember reading in a book on entrepreneurship decades ago about how the average entrepreneur must endure the process of failure some 7 times on average until they find their first win.\n\nYou have accumulated vast knowledge and you are only now testing it in the marketplace, but you are still very young, don't despair.\n\nSylvester Stallone put his heart and soul into Rocky and was rejected 1500 times. He kept going.\n\nThe process with entrepreneurship is something like the 'spaghetti method' - throw enough spaghetti against the wall and something will stick.\n\nI think of dual track development from Software Engineering... that is, you have an ideation track - come up with ideas, produce a low cost PoC... test it and decide keep it or kill it. If you keep it, turn out an MVP (minimum viable product) and test in the marketplace. Do it at low cost and keep going until you get something worth keeping.\n\nMy old friend told me that an entrepreneur is someone who goes out hunting and shoots his gun in ten different directions... if something falls out of the sky, he runs towards it.\n\nThe trick is not to go broke trying... each failure costs money and takes its toll not only financially but on your mental health, emotions, nerves and self-esteem. \n\nAll successful entrepreneurs follow the same bumpy, often heartbreaking road. The trick is to iterate quickly and at low cost.\n\nYou are doing it right - failing forward. That's how you learned to ride a bike... you kept falling until you didn't. It's the only way.\n\nGood luck OP. You are doing fine.   \nYou can always sell your freedom to a day job with your skill set and do side hustles. That's how I got 'here'. LoL",

Hire a marketer (or learn Meta/Google ads on YouTube) and start outreaching clients on Facebook and Google. You should have a great offer &amp; a solid landing page. You can acquire a client under $1000. Your profitability depends on your AOV (average order value).\n\n2. Build a solid cold email outreach infrastructure and start outreaching clients. Who are your clients? If they are on LinkedIn, create a LinkedIn outreach strategy to achieve your goal.\n\nIt solely depends on your niche. I suggest spending 30% of your monthly profit ($3000) on client outreach strategy and build more clientele from there.",

Could you turn that into a template or semi-custom package you sell for like $3k-$5k instead of building from scratch every time? If you're doing dashboards or CRMs or booking systems over and over, that's your product right there.\n\nBefore building anything new though, I'd automate the repetitive stuff in your current business first. Onboarding, follow-ups, invoicing, whatever's eating your time. I helped someone do this and they got back like 8 hours a week.

There is a risk they might say \"no\" and you loose that gig, but you gain insight in to what your price should be and that is way more valuable. Wash rinse, repeat and you can maybe, over a series experiments get to the 7k extra a month you want. I would not recommend doing this for all clients, all gigs, until you've demonstrated this works.\n\nBy the way - if the client says \"yes\" they will value and appreciate your work more. Whenever I've been able to get the clients to pay a lot more, then they say \"wow that was expensive, but it was well worth it\". That's what you want.\n\n2) Do a test with a new client - charge that client two and a half times what you currently charge but give them a \"30% discount\" on that new higher price because you want to \"invest in the relationship\". That way the client feels like they are getting a great deal and you are getting closer your goals. \n\nThat way the client will really really value what you do - but also think they are getting a special deal at the same time.\n\n3) Launch something that creates stand alone recurring revenue - an app, or little SaaS type play.\n\n4) Optimize your own workflow to reduce the number of hours it takes to do your work so you have time to work on something else.\n\n5) Focus on a narrow area, with a core set of technology you can reuse across a range of different projects.",

      "selftext": "Long story short, I started my business 10 years ago with a little less than $2k to my name. My original goal was just to overtake my earnings at the time of $40k/yr. In the beginning things were rough... real rough. My first 3 months were crickets drawing my bank account down to cents.. Fast forward to the 4th month and I finally got a client. Because I was so young, my overhead was minimal so one client got me by. To not bore you will my life story, I have grown the business to \\~$1M annually without taking on any outside money. The ride has been wild and I no longer perform the actual service that we offer. I have figured out how to scale a rather unscalable business in a way that really nobody else has figured out. Here is the thing... the burnout I feel is debilitating to the point where it is hard for me to get through my days. I really used to love what it is we do and to my knowledge we are the only ones doing this at this scale without private equity or VC. All of this said, I know I am leaving TONS of $$ on the table and really no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to build what needs to be built in order to scale further. This is part of the debilitation that I feel. I have swung 40 times (thats an exaggeration) and stuck out for one reason or another. Whether it is I don't have enough money to build it or I find somebody that says they can build it and they can't. I hate the feeling of being lost or without direction and really I am starting to actually lose my damn mind. The worst part is it is only me at the top and I have nobody to really talk to about all this. Running solo in the desert trying to find rain clouds and for whatever reason I just keep finding salt flats. Advice?\n\n  \nEDIT, UPDATE &amp; ANSWERED QUESTIONS: The business is a private chef business located in Austin, Texas. When I started, I was cooking at the best restaurant here at the time that is named Odd Duck. It was grueling work and I was not getting paid for my time like I thought I should have been. Anyways, one day I was cleaning up the grill station and a couple across the open kitchen bar asked me if I would be interested in doing a dinner party for them. I said \"sure\" not knowing anything about it at all. I reached out to them the week after and met them at their home... it turned out to be THE penthouse of the four seasons residence here in ATX. They wanted tacos for 30 people.. I performed the service and they wrote me a check for $3600+ $700 in tip. This is where I knew I had something. In my mind, I immediately said \"There has got to me more people like this\". 2 months later I had built my website, created a brand image, and opened a bank account &amp; LLC. I gave my 2 weeks notice with zero clients and put on my chef coat in the middle of Texas summer and went door to door at the biggest houses I could find. I would pound pavement for 6 hours a day for 3 months to hear nothing but crickets (turns out, knowing what I know now, summer is the WORST time here for my business). As stated above on the 4th month, one client reached out and I closed that deal for weekly meal prep @ $500/wk+groceries. I was able to float.. Over the next 4-5 months I had earned roughly $35k. I kept cooking solo for the next 4.5 years, 7 days a week, all holidays, etc. \n\nIn the 5th year, I sat down at my computer because I was behind on office work and come to find out that I had missed roughly $300,000 in potential revenue by simply not having the bandwidth to take on more work by myself. I hired another chef (and this is why it is an unscalable business) but that didn't help much because most requests come for basically 3 days of the week. Thursday, Friday and Saturday. This means that even if both of us were at a dinner party cooking, I was still missing out on between 1-8 requests for service on that Saturday. This continued to happen week after week after week. I tried hiring people on a base pay weekly + they keep 100% of their tip. This blew up in my face in said summer slump because I was paying the base but the chefs were not working. It was working but I wasn't making any money because the summer would bleed me dry. Right at this time Covid hits.. I have to lay everybody off.. you all know how that went.. I came up with a meal delivery service and barely got through this stage but I figured out how to keep the business running. During this time, I told 3 of my chefs \"If you stay with me, I will split evenly whatever comes in so we can all stay afloat during this time\".  Well about 3 months into the pandemic, here in Texas, our Governor came on the TV and announced that we were \"open to gatherings of 14 people and less\". Being in the dinner party scene, my business' phones went crazy. Right away, people (past and present clients) wanted to get together with their friends and family at the house to have a party. \n\nA new era is born. Since the old way wasn't working (paying a base pay weekly + tip) I knew things had to change. During the meal delivery days, I instinctively went with that \"rev split model\" and it seemed to work out. So I kept with it. 50% to the chef and 50% to me and the chef keeps 100% of the tip they receive. This is where things finally changed and how I was able to make it to my first $1M year. The beauty is that the chef gets to work less than they work in a restaurant but earn double to quadruple what they were earning in the restaurant. I stopped cooking and started to figure out how to scale this model and operate the business. This is where I am at... 4 years later... 3 broken process buildouts... a software stack that is everywhere.. and I am beginning to break. Yes, what I have works but it is clunky and make shifted. I have, I can't even count (in the thousands) how many leads that \"went with another option\" because we are high in pricing compared to competitors (that are only a one man show). I know how to fix this, I know what needs to be built, but the way things are right now, it cannot be done. I have tried many different things but at the end of the day people (developers &amp; automation specialists) tell me the same thing. \"what you are trying to build is going to cost you \\~$3-$500,000 and we can't promise you that it will solve your main concerns\". \n\n  \nYes, what I am trying to build out is complex. Yes, I understand that it is going to take $$ to do it. No, I do not have half a million dollars to roll the dice on something that is not going to move my needle FOR SURE. ",

The scary stuff you listed is real though.\n\nWhat I’d do in your shoes:\n\n* Stay where you are for 3 to 6 months.\n* Quietly build your own client pipeline on the side.\n* Get 2 or 3 clients that would work with “you” not the brand.\n* Build a small cash buffer. 4 to 6 months of living costs.\n\nFor finding clients I’d treat it like outbound sales:\n\n* Scrape target companies from linkedin or job boards.\n* Push them into a sheet.\n* Use n8n or make to run cold email sequences from a custom domain.\n* Track replies in a simple crm or even a google sheet.\n\nAdmin can be automated more than you think. I use:\n\n* google apps script to auto create invoices from a sheet.\n* calendar bookings and canned emails for updates.\n* n8n to log all calls and notes into a central place.\n\nHealth insurance and 0 months are the 2 big mental blockers. Buffer + pipeline fixes 80% of that. The first 3 to 6 months on your own will feel rough. After that it just becomes normal.\n\nIf I was producing 500k+ for a shop for 100k back I’d be planning my exit, but I’d do it with a safety net not overnight.",

The mission was noble.\n\nAnd we failed.\n\nWe were a classic founding team: **3 Coders, 0 Marketers.** We spent nights debating tech stacks and zero minutes talking to customers. We fell into the \"Field of Dreams\" trap: *If we build it, they will come.* (They didn't).\n\nI wrote a full breakdown of the 10 reasons we shut down, but here are the 3 that hurt the most:\n\n**1. The \"Mansion\" MVP** We didn't build a Minimum Viable Product. We built a mansion. We developed for iOS AND Android simultaneously before we had a single user. *Lesson:* If you haven't validated the idea, build *one* feature on *one* platform.\n\n**2. The \"No Competition\" Trap** We did a competitor analysis and found nothing. We celebrated. In reality, an empty market is usually a red flag. It means there is no market. If a real problem exists, someone is usually already trying to solve it.\n\n**3. We Wasted Money on \"Pro\" Tools** We wanted to feel like a \"real company,\" so we burned cash on premium hosting, enterprise email, and legal structures before we had $1 in revenue. *Lesson:* You can run a startup for almost $0 these days. Don't scale your costs before you scale your revenue.\n\n**The Full Retrospective** I broke down the other 7 mistakes (including why \"Trying to change human behavior\" is a death sentence for apps) in the full post on My Blog\n\nHappy to answer questions about the shutdown process or the tech we wasted time on.",

I also used a person in the ad thinking people are attracted to a face as nobody in the entire page has that. It's just walls and walls of texts and logos. \n\nIt's been going gangbusters since day 1 the newspaper hit homes. The ad is betting me 1 to 2 new clients every day. Half of them tell me about how they got ripped off by the competitors and yesterday one client asked if what I was charging was enough and whether I wanted more, which was real nice of her. \n\nSeveral weeks ago I was starting to panic, both my wife and I were applying for jobs we absolutely didn't want to do. I'm just over the moon that something so simple actually worked!\n\nThe beauty of these clients is they keep coming back for more and tell their friends. What a bloody relief in this market!\n\nLittle bit of a side gig story but wanted to share as well.  I also found out my local bottle $0.10 refund recycling centre loans out wheelie bins and picks them up on the regular so I managed to convince two restaurant owners who weren't recycling to let me handle all their bottles and cans. Both said yes. I'm thinking I may be able to make $10,000 a year just for hooking them up with the recyclers as a middleman.",

We definitely tried a few that ended up taking more time than saving haha. But here are some that stood out tbh:\n\n* Taking complicated pdfs and inputting them into gemini 3 pro and asking it to produce an infographic on the material. Amazing results.\n* Gamma can create a fully designed presentation  from a one line prompt. This was damn impressive! \n* I have an automation using Frizerly that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can even use trends and latest news to come up with right topics and content! Most of these are truly helpful blogs that are education! So it works great for both Google rankings and existing customers! \n* The other one that surprised me was using AI for technical document analysis. Client sends over a spec sheet or compliance doc, 80 pages of dense text. Used to be half a day of reading. Now I get a summary of what actually matters for our scope in 10 minutes. \n* Finally for photo editing, marketing assets, you can now just use Google Nano Banana Pro! Its insanely good at converting simple product images to professional photoshoots in seconds!",

A few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic about the field, but I have reached a point where this life no longer satisfies me. You are probably wondering why... Well, a year and a half ago, I met the woman who represents me, the kind of woman I dreamed of being with, and going on voyages has become increasingly difficult. I work one month on a ship and one month at home, and I get paid 100% of the same salary for both months. At work, I started to experience anxiety and racism. I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home. The food is very bad, I always have stomach problems, and I always miss home and my loved ones. For now, I have an emergency fund that will cover my expenses for about 8 months. My goal is to reach an amount that will cover 24 months of expenses and then focus on trading and another business I want to start with my girlfriend. I thought about saving some money in addition to the emergency fund for any unforeseen circumstances in the coming year. What do you think? Am I being realistic about what I want to do? Next year, I want to start that business and gradually give up my job. Do you think it's a good idea to quit even if it doesn't pay as much as my current job, even though I have my savings?",

Most people quit a job with nothing saved.\n* Trading isn't a business, it is a legal form of gambling. Investing is putting money into things for the very long term and letting natural highs and lows average out over time. Trading is guessing the highs and lows, and sometimes picking the winners, and sometimes picking the losers. Head over to r/PersonalFinance and read the hundreds of horror stories of people who blow tens of thousands in savings chasing wins \"trading\" digital currency or stocks. At least r/wallstreetbets calls it what is is... a \"bet\" aka \"gambling.\" Get that through your skull or you'll end up another broke sob story.\n* Starting a business is hard work. Other than wanting out of your sailor career, what do you know and what skills to make you successful? What kind of business are you starting? Also, if you can start it with a person who is on the short 100% of the time, is it good enough to start NOW and let them run it when you're away, and then when you're there you bust your ass for a month? Then you build up to something so that when you quit it already exists and is making money!\n* Your girlfriend is... to be blunt... your GIRLFRIEND. Not your wife (yet). The intensity of your relationship will go up immensely when you are home 100% of the time, and even moreso when you start a business together. You're putting a lot of stock into that working out, and spoiler: business with family and romantic partners often ends badly.\n\nSo... your plan as presented here kinda sucks, other than saving money.\n\n* Keep saving.\n* We all dislike our work, whether we are self employed or not... get over it.\n* Stop gambling in the markets. It isn't a business.\n* Make a plan for your business. Test your product or offering. Do market research. Perhaps start your business anyway with a partner on the shore.\n* Have some more time with your girlfriend before you upend your life for her. Don't risk ruining a good thing by tying y'all's financial future to starting a business together.",

But that's me. You don't quite your job until you are confident the business will fulfill your needs moving forward. And not just that, but also able to fund it's growth and the hard times while still fulfilling your needs. That's not a common thing, so the default is always no.\n\n  \nNot to poke my nose where it doesn't belong, but is it possible the racism you are feeling has less to do with your race and more to do with \"I simply wake up unmotivated. I don't want to do anything, just let the days pass and go home.\" ?\n\nI mean, I don't care what your race is, but if even you describe yourself this way, i'm not going to like working with you. I would specifically try to avoid you. Very common that many would act out against you. Especially in isolated workplaces like that. And when people do that, they use anything to show their frustrations with you. Which can look a lot like racism, or be misconstrued as racism. But the root cause was that you aren't pulling your own weight. Or your attitude brings people down in a job that probably needs a positive vibe.\n\nNot trying to tell you what you are experiencing. Just trying to say you seem like a reasonable person. You might just be misreading the situation is all.",

Would love to hear what has worked for you.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n***Edit: Thanks for all the input so far! Just to clarify, the staff involved has already been dismissed. I’m asking for PMS recommendations with full awareness that no system will solve this 100%. This will be implemented alongside proper staffing, controls, and processes to prevent similar exploitation going forward.\n",

Begin with a side hustle or a small project alongside your job. At 18 years you still have a lot to learn and the best is to learn by doing especially when the cost of failure is low. If you chose right you can eventually grow your side hustle into a full-time entrepreneurship. Think what you are passionate about, find problems in this space and figure out how to solve them.

The initial demand was for $20k settlement plus legal fees, they sent over the actual settlement agreement template and the terms are wild beyond just the money.\nAgreement requires: bringing site into \"substantial compliance\" with wcag 2.2 level aa within the term of agreement, 24 month monitoring period where they can come back and check, if you breach any terms they can reopen the case, strict confidentiality clause so you can't even tell other business owners about the amount or terms.\nThe kicker is buried in section 4 about remediation, you have to make \"good faith efforts\" but there's no clear standard for what that means. So even after paying $20k+ and doing work, they could potentially argue you didn't try hard enough.\nI talked to a lawyer who said these agreements are designed to be vague so they can keep coming back, the confidentiality clause means most business owners can't even compare notes or warn each other.\nAnyone else seen agreements like this?

What I suspect is that more people are actually fighting these claims and making the argument that the claimant is not actually being discriminated against, and this is just a cash grab due to poor ADA implementation.\n\nThus, these ongoing terms would be an attempt to legitimise the claim by making it appear that the suit really WAS about making the website compliant. I would strongly suspect that they would never even look at the website again, once a settlement was made.\n\nYour friend has a problem, because there's nothing they can do to fix their website - it's entirely down to Shopify and the theme designer to sort it, but you can bet there's terms and conditions that absolve them of any responsibility. I believe even the bits Shopify DO commit to are only WCAG 2.1 compliant, not 2.2 (which became a standard in Oct 2025, so very recently).\n\nI would check if ADA actually requires WCAG2.2 for starters, it would be unusual for them to have updated the rules so quickly after a standard became official. If not, then seek legal advice on what the implications of that are - they can't mandate you are more accessible than the law requires.\n\nI'd also petition every level of government you can, hard and frequently, about this. And get all of your small business, website-owning friends to do the same. At some point, this shit will come for them all, and the financial impact can be huge because it's almost always a open/shut technical win for the claimants.\n\nEdit: I forgot to share this, which is essentially Shopify's view on the matter: [https://www.shopify.com/news/accessibility-lawsuits](https://www.shopify.com/news/accessibility-lawsuits) \\- no answers, but an interesting read all the same.",

I know this for a fact because of one of those friends that was sued got sued again by the same company because he didn’t have stuff like all his alt text and other crap labeled properly. For example if you were just to do a standard rollover on an image, nothing would pop up to describe what’s in that image. That’s dumb on his part because that’s basic stuff and it helps with SEO.

I notice that one employee submitted the exact same Uber receipt twice (same ride and same amount 38 bucks) once in February and again in April. at first I figured it was just a mistake like maybe they just accidentally uploaded the same photo twice or something\n\nI then started actually looking at their other submissions and that's when I was able to figure it out. Personal grocery runs labeled as 'office supplies' dinner with their friends labeled as 'client meeting' and I'm pretty sure some of the receipt screenshots were edited because the fonts looked off and dates didn't line up with the transaction amounts\n\nI went back through about 6 months of their reports and conservatively they probably stole around $2500 (2544 bucks to be exact) from us. When I confronted them they got immediately defensive and tried to say it was \"unclear what counted as a business expense\" and then quit on the spot. Yes they quit on the spot  \n  \nYesterday I got paranoid cuz I started thinking of all the people that could have been doing this too and I just never noticed because I've never dealt with expenses  \nI don't want to become some paranoid micromanager who audits every coffee purchase but I also clearly can't just operate on the honor system anymore. I feel like I need some kind of actual system but I also don't know what's reasonable for a company our size (19 people and maybe 25 on January)",

I don't think it's as malicious as others are saying, hanlon's razor and all that. We have no idea what the workload the original bookkeeper is under. I would to say it's easy for the bookkeeper to look over these things as they are just assuming everything was approved and they believe there was no ill-intent from who they were getting the receipts from.",

Instead of firing the bookkeeper I think you should have controls in place where all receipts submitted to her to be entered/paid out need to be signed and approved by management/owner. This sounds like the bookkeeper is an employee and not a hired firm as op was taking over duties and I very highly doubt this bookkeeper is a CPA as some are saying here because I don't know a single CPA who would ever take a job working for a bookkeeper's salary at a small company. In this case, the employee would have been given instructions and told what to do for their job and if there were no controls put in place then it is clearly not their fault and all of you business owners out here wanting a witch hunt for the bookkeeper should probably make sure that proper controls are in place for your own businesses because there is no recourse against the bookkeeper.

We call the hotel to get his hotel bill, because he was covering for some underlings.  But then he submitted his hotel bill - and every room cost more per night than the bill we got from the hotel.

          "body": "I have investigated fraud and embezzlement through expense reports and vendor invoices, and more often than not the investigation proved the allegations false. Prevention through clear expectations, audits, and internal controls should be your focus. \n\nGiven the employee's response of running, I would say there is a good chance they were guilty. However, make sure you keep evidence and write up a synopsis should they try to get unemployment for a hostile workplace given their assertion of vague policy and being confronted.  \n\nWhen people commit fraud, they usually put in a lot of effort to make sure nothing will raise a red flag. Dinners coincided with business trips or visiting clients or conferences or recruiting events.  The fraud would be submitting the same receipt that someone else paid and submitted to another company. Do you require attendees to be listed (you should because iirc employee meals even while traveling are written off at 50% and potential clients at 100%) allowing you to confirm with attendees during an audit. \n\nWhere is the proof that they were personal groceries and not items for the break room, meeting snacks, or cleaning supplies? \n\nSame questions for the meals out. How do you know that it wasn't a potential client, employee meal, etc?\n\nUber fares being the same on two different days is rare, unless the fares and tips were of different value. \n\nGo through what each error was, and update your policy to include internal controls to combat such fraud or abuse from happening. \n\nRequire paper receipts to be given to payroll or whoever may need to submit them to the IRS for auditing. Spot checks to verify information matches paper and pdf. This activity of auditing should be declared in the policy (prevention is preferred) and performed whenever something doesn't feel right and randomly. If someone has the bandwidth, like a receptionist, a 100% review can be done; at least for 6 months or until you are comfortable. \n\nTo avoid two different employees submitting the same receipt, if you're using Excel, merge expense reports and analyze for duplicate charges before approving. For this to work, all expenses must be submitted in the month they occurred. And all reports are due by the Wednesday before payroll processing to give you time to audit. \n\nFor grocery trips, make sure that itemized receipts are required for reimbursement. \n\nIf employees have corporate cards, make them mandatory unless permission is granted before the expense, list acceptable reasons to use personal card. The employees are getting your miles or cashback if using their personal cards. Banks/ issuers will let you export all data for the month and some like AmEx, will have categories prepopulated and will allow you to add your policy (rules) and will flag charges that are not “in policy” to help audit.  Policy here is not from the written policy that requires adding attendees or client info to the receipt, instead this policy lets you create rules - such as dollar limits by category - that you add to help ensure you don't miss a charge that you would like to review more closely.\n\nMake the written policy clear with the intent to avoid inappropriate expenses and hold employees accountable when they violate this policy. For every issue you identify in your detailed review of others’ reports, develop an internal control that would prevent it from recurring. Include auditing and approval procedures. For example, learn how to identify changes in PDF files after scanning/photo upload; I wonder if AI could identify the slight differences in font pitch and type?\n\nIf you are struggling to determine the proper controls for your business, Google expense policies for the Fortune 5 companies (I even wrote one of them) and use parts, as appropriate, for your industry. \n\nWhen you are done updating your policy, run it through ChatGPT, with a command to address any outstanding concerns you have. Or post it here, or in other appropriate subs, and ask for help. Need a starting point? Ask AI for common ways for small businesses to combat expense fraud. In my experience, this is where I see AI to be quite accurate and helpful.",

Another simple way is to tell everyone all expenses will be audited for fraud for the last 3 years and see who else quits.  Good riddance.  Nothing like a good clean out to help the bottom line.",

If it was during travel they would only expense food for $75 a day and we would have the option for a digital card or just to submit expense before the pay period ended. If it was for customer experience yes a limit on that and photo proof we were giving the customers an experience, etc. the more mindful we were for spending we would see a bonus and if you had to max out expenses but it gave more ROI (Return of Investment) you would also see a bonus at the end for being smart about the risks you took. I always agree with putting a limit of those who are in those positions to spend money and anything over the limit must be cleared by HR. Hope this helps",

Just set a super clear rule for what’s okay and what’s not, and maybe use a simple expense app so stuff can’t be edited easy. Even small teams need that, trust me.\n\nAnd yeah, $2.5k is not small.

Tools like Ramp help because every expense has to match the actual transaction and the receipt + details get tied directly to the card swipe.

We are going to be expanding this rule because of the continuous onslaught of people trying to use our subscribers as an unpaid market research group. That isn't the point of the sub and the ease of creating AI wrappers or vibe coding apps has made it so bad the noise from these posts are blocking out real questions about small business. \n\nThis is particularly annoying given anyone can look at our past posts and create a map of what is important or challenging for small businesses with far greater accuracy than a single spammy \"question\" post.\n\n- Research on small businesses (i.e. asking what their challenges are, if XYZ app will help, how good your small business offering is, etc.) will be removed unless posted by legitimate academic sources. Additional rules will apply for academic research.\n\n- Posts of this type will be allowed as comments in one of our stickied posts. If these comments engage widely we may set up a new sticky for them.\n\n- We still only allow questions to be posted. Mods may post or enable non-questions for specific purposes. These are generally PSAs but can be about critical events.\n\n- As before, posts directly or indirectly for promotion will be removed, including those authored by AI. Using AI to translate might be OK but AI slop is not.\n\nAs always we welcome feedback on the rule change. \n\nAs a separate note, you might like to know we've been operating several posts as anti-spammer honeypots. These are posts are popular but highly attractive to spammers. The posts are under continuous monitoring and when a spammer makes their comment the company name or offer is banned universally across the sub. Banning the company name means even different accounts can't spam us with it. Feel free to tell folks we operate honeypots. If the bad guys know there is a risk to posting here perhaps they'll send the spam somewhere else.\n\nThanks for your posts and I look forward to hearing your comments - even the critical ones - as we always have room to improve.\n",

I started this small travel agency a couple years back, nothing crazy, but it somehow worked and I made like 70k over time. As I started making money I also started traveling a lot, just seeing the world, learning stuff… one of those trips was to Kenya.Someone I met there took me to this Hass avocado farm. I swear I didn’t even care about farming before but something about that place stuck with me. The trees, the export thing, the whole operation… don’t know why but it hit me.\nBefore that I was just doing the travel agency thing, but then the whole model started getting copied everywhere and abused. Margins dropped, everything felt off, so I shut it down before it ate everything I worked for.When I got back home I kept reading about Hass avocados nonstop. Like for two years. Everything from seedlings to climate stuff to yields and prices. Deep rabbit hole.Then I found some land in Ethiopia that fit everything I learned and I bought it. Honestly that moment felt wild, like “damn… this is mine.”And now I’m kinda just sitting here thinking, ok… what’s the actual next move?\nIt’s weird going from a travel agency to avocado farming. Didn’t expect life to go this direction at all.Anyone else ever make a complete switch like this?How do you know if you’re moving smart or just chasing something because it felt right in the moment?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

But i'd personally create a nice and memorable brand. Maybe even a funny brand. Brand all of my shipping containers. Maybe add branded stickers on every avocado. And if business goes well keep reinvesting and expanding. Buy more and more avocado farms until your brand is thriving.\n\nIf you are feeling bold id say maybe try to target european or usa buyers who may want premium quality avocados.

Not sure how hard it is to press it or what the margins are, but that could be a play for you. \n\nYou also might partner with a current export firm or a distribution partner, and work-out a revenue share by co packing or branding / licensing play. Get some bottles, simple label maker, and put their name and logo on...have them ship and sell, u just grow and produce. \n\nContact all of your prior relationships from your travel agency, such as the destinations, hotels, chefs, restaurants etc and ask them if you can send a small sample to test if they like the product and speed to destinations/ costs... maybe put 20 in a box and send them out to gage logistical issues... \n\nBeing agri product, there prob needs to be permits licensed and approved steps and stamps fro. UsDA for example... \n\nOil might be an easier play the actual produce but I could be wrong on that...\n\nIf going organic, there is a way you can apply to get permit and seal of approval, most likely from USDA as well If shipping to UsA ...\n\nJust things that are coming to mind here.... \n\nGood luck and hope it goes well for you!",

      "selftext": "I was recently in NYC and stopped into one of the many small coffee shops in Manhattan, pretty close to Chinatown. A tiny storefront, just two tables inside plus some display shelves, a small case for baked goods, an ordering/serving counter. It might have been 150 square feet or so inside the customer area plus some room out back for making drinks. Coffee was $4 or so, a latte was $5, a croissant was $4 or $5, banana bread was $3. Hours are 8 AM to 7 PM, seven days a week.\n\nAnyway, it got me wondering how businesses like this stay open. With all of the competition plus the low per-customer revenue, how does a little place like this stay afloat in a big city? I assume the rent must be thousands per month. Do they need to own the space? Am I just not thinking through the math and not realizing that multiple small purchases a day add up? Are they running on a loan they'll never re-pay?\n\nI think about this a lot with random stores in cities. Like a little boutique-type store that sells funky little gifts, candles, greeting cards, etc. How does a place like that stay open in a presumably-desirable storefront area in a big city? Are there really enough people stopping in to support it?\n\nI guess the answer is obviously \"yes\" since they are open, but it doesn't make sense to me...",

Even a tiny coffee shop can survive if they have steady foot traffic and sell enough drinks and snacks per day. Many small spots supplement in-store sales with catering, wholesale to offices, or local delivery. Rent is huge, but some find deals in less obvious areas, share spaces, or have flexible leases. They’re rarely cash cows, but if the owner keeps costs tight and builds a loyal local following, it’s enough to stay afloat.

Some of my folks are out-of-state and I don't think they would have wanted to attend, but all the folks in town came. I would have flown the out-of-state folks in if they wanted. The wife of the only married lady was not able to attend, but my spouse (who works for the company) attended as did my son who lives in the area (we live 1K miles away). My bottom line is that I do what the majority of employees want. I will travel to one of my jobsites for a lunch in the next few months. We are spread across the country in small groups, so getting everyone together is not really feasible. Frankly, I don't buy the \"cash compensation\" as these events are about the team, not the individual. I give raises and bonuses to individuals. For folks who say, \"just give me the cash\" rather than have an event, they can stay home if others want to do something. I send a b-day card to every employee with a $20 gift card for Darden restaurants. Seems silly, but it is the number one thing we get positive feedback on from employees. I think it is primarily because I write each one a card, but as I mentioned we are nation/world-wide with small groups of employees, so I encourage them to use their gift cards for a group lunch and some do. Good on you for the one-weeks bonus. We could not afford to do that, but we do most of the rest that you are doing. Hats off to you.",

Services like **Firstbase** or **Stripe Atlas** handle the LLC formation (usually Delaware or Wyoming) and the EIN for you remotely.\n2. **Banking:** Once you have the EIN, look at **Mercury** or **Brex**. They are built for startups and friendly to non-resident owners. They give you a real US routing number.\n3. **Looking Legit (The most important part):** Brokers don't check your tax returns first; they check your digital footprint.\n   * Get a real US phone number (OpenPhone or Google Voice) so you have a +1 country code.\n   * Update your LinkedIn location to your US LLC base (or at least make it clear you operate there).\n   * Have a clean, one-page site that highlights *process* over location.\n\nDon't overthink the 'Proof of Funds' yet.

      "selftext": "Here's some info about the business: I own a small business with 2 employees. I give 5% guaranteed annual raises that kick in on January 1. I also provide a 401k match of up to 4%. In the past Christmas bonuses have been 1% of wages earned for the year.\n\nThe bad news is that gross sales are down about 11% this year. They were also down around 9% last year. I've absorbed the costs and have kept the increases and benefits. Not sure how much longer I can hold out. It's only for 2 employees though so I think I can continue with the above for another year.\n\nHow are other small business owners navigating bonuses/raises/benefits as your sales continue to decline?\n\n  \nEdit: \n\nJust to clarify, the employees have done everything asked of them. They show up, shut up, and keep up. They work hard and are reliable. They are professional and polite. Even though the business is going through a downturn I am having trouble with the idea of withholding something from them that they are not responsible for. I understand bonuses are performance based, but their performance hasn't diminished. It's just people out there are struggling. And for those that are telling me to focus on sales, I've definitely tried a few things this year. I switched to a new POS system that better tracks customer behavior and sends reminders for increased engagement. I've offered more sales. The employees have changed displays/endcaps every month as well as getting rid of slow moving SKUs and replacing them with new products. I have gone through every expense and tried to find a way to lower overhead costs. Sometimes the economy just sucks and the free market puts you in your place. So this is less about a \"bonus\" and more about being a \"gift.\"",

My thought is that I am not doing any employee a favor by putting the company at risk by allowing overhead to reach a point where we are less competitive.",

We just hit 40k MRR last month but I cannot shake the scarcity mindset and it's starting to affect how we operate. Like I'm talking about obsessing over every single expense to an unhealthy degree.\n\nLast week my business partner wanted to upgrade our project management software to a plan that costs an extra $200/month and I literally spent two hours building a case for why we didn't need it (fun factwe definitely need it) I just couldn't handle the idea of adding another recurring cost. She was pretty mad at me and I fully understand here I just don't know the reason behind me being like this\n\nI grew up pretty broke and bootstrapped this thing on like 3k and now even though we're profitable and growing I still operate like we're one expense away from shutting down. I review our business checking account basically every day. I still use a personal card for a bunch of business expenses because I feel guilty putting them on the company card even though that makes no sense whatsoever\n\nMy partner thinks I should talk to a therapist about it which honestly might not be a bad idea but I'm also super curious if anyone else deals with this? Like at what revenue point did you stop feeling like every dollar going out was a personal attack? Or does it never go away?\n\nThe ironic thing is I'm probably COSTING us money by being so cheap since we're definitely underinvesting in tools and people because I'm too anxious about everything? Anyone has any tips on how to improve with the way I'm dealing with everything? Thank you",

In order to grow, you should be expected to invest a certain amount back into your company. \n\nFor me, I had to work hard to change my mindset on money. Budgeting was a huge help. I committed that a % of profits would be set aside for a rainy day, and a % would be invested in our continued growth. Whether it’s hiring people, adding to our tech stack, training, etc. \n\nThat has helped as I have a set number to work with - and from there I prioritize investing in things based on the expected ROI. For example, If I add a tool for our team that saves everyone a few hours every week in admin work, they can spend that time doing something that helps our company elsewhere - like more work tied to revenue generation. If I hire someone that I can delegate tactical work to, it frees me up to me a multiplier for the company and focus on sales. \n\nIt doesn’t mean I spend like crazy, but it really helped me having a set budget in the early days that was specifically tied to investing in our growth. \n\nGood luck!",

Since you're suffering with expenses, what tool are you using? We have Ramp integrated within our company for expenses/cards which definitely helped since everything's automatic (automatic matching receipt and you can issue cards to everyone including yourself so that you can follow all the expenses way easier)\n\nAlso your partner is right about the software btw. That $20/month probably saves way more than that in wasted time. At 40k MRR after 18 months you're doing amazing!!

      "selftext": "We have a 7 day policy for submitting expenses but nobody follows it and our finance manager is too polite to actually enforce it. He'll send these really friendly reminder emails asking if it's possible for them to expense it but everyone ignores them. When I say them I'm talking about my coworkers\n\nLast week he was trying to close the books for October and there were still 3 people who hadn't submitted anything. He spent like 2 hours tracking people down in slack asking about random charges from weeks ago that nobody remembers. The day after I had lunch with him and he looked pretty sad and he (I didn't brought it up) brought up how it's super hard to deal with the expenses in our company since nobody is responsible\n\nThe worst part is he's genuinely a great guy and I feel terrible watching people take advantage of how nice he is. He'll never push back or enforce consequences so everyone knows they can just submit whenever and he'll deal with it\n\nI know there's nothing from my side that I can do about this but I just want to know if I can propose something to him in order to fix this. I'm also planning to talk to some of our coworkers and ask them to be more responsible because they're literally adults WITH KIDS who are doing this. Unbelievable!!  \nHappy late Thanksgiving btw \\^ ",

      "selftext": "A client of mine is dealing with a really tough dilemma. He runs a small digital agency (about 10 people). One of his key employees — a senior specialist in SEO and paid ads — sometimes doesn’t show up to work without warning (pretty consistently 1–3 times a month). There have also been a few instances where he came in clearly drunk, and even more often with a strong hangover.  \nIn 99% of cases, the obvious move would be: have a talk, and if nothing changes — let him go. But here’s the problem: this guy carries the workload of two or even three people. He often stays late to finish urgent tasks and actively helps junior team members.  \nOn one hand — even with his issues, he’s more valuable than most others on the team, and my client is genuinely afraid of losing him.  \nOn the other hand — repeated conversations haven’t helped. His behavior isn’t improving, and other employees are starting to notice. In fact, there are already signs that some teammates are becoming more careless about punctuality and discipline, copying his example.  \nSo firing him feels like a bad option… but leaving things as they are is also risky.  \n  \nHas anyone seen a similar situation? How did you (or your client) navigate it? Would really appreciate any real-life insights.",

On the one hand, this man obviously needs help. If he wants help and it is offered, it could be a great opportunity for him. If he doesn’t want to seek some form of sobriety and make up for his past behavior, only so many chances can be given. On the other hand, his behavior is affecting the whole team and those people’s lives and feelings matter too, from a kind human standpoint and a business standpoint. \n\nI am now sober but have been in this employee’s shoes and have also with lots of active alcoholics, before and after sobriety. Let me tell you, it takes a toll on coworkers, even in subtle ways. The toll on the team has clearly already started. It sounds callous to say “Shape up or ship out,” but if nothing changes, nothing changes. \n\nAs someone else suggested, read the chapter “To Employers” in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. You might also read the first few chapters that explain AA’s view on alcoholism as a disease, if you’re curious, but it’s not strictly necessary. The book was written by a businessman and the advice in the “To Employers” chapter was probably the most accurate and qualified advice of the whole book. The language reflects the time period it was written but if you try to think like a 1930s stock broker it’s easy enough to understand the meaning. \n\nLastly, for your consideration, I got fired from a job 6 years ago and I have been sober for six years. To this day losing that job is one of the best things that has happened to me, although I certainly didn’t see it that way at the time.",

      "selftext": "So my family's been looking at purchasing a second business. Its a reputable gas station franchise, newly established. Its a suburban area and the area has a population around 35,000 (2.5 mile radius) and nearby metropolitan city above 500k. It's near an intersection of 2 interstate highways, right off of the exit of one of them. \n\nI've been looking through the financials for the past couple of weeks, going through their franchise approval, meeting with the owners, etc and here's the basic gist of what I am expecting to get in terms of profits. \n\nThey are average in total of 123k in merchandise sales monthly. They're able to keep a 35-40% profit margin, I am getting 40% gross profit, but lets say 35%. So they're keeping roughly $43,050. The franchise takes 25% cut, leaving them with $32,288. They have 12 pumps running and are getting roughly 7,000 in their share from the franchise (franchise gives 0.05 cents on the gallon). So in a month they're grossing 39,288 before expenses. Now adding the expenses; labor (15k), card processing (3.5k), utilities (3k), operational supplies (1.4k), maintenance/repair/yard (2.8k), misc. (2k). One thing to mention is rent is really low. The location is really nice, great for a gas station traffic wise, not any nearby gas stations, but since the franchise owns the building, they say their model is to keep the rent low, so only $2,600. In that area a business like that, rent are up almost as much as 10k. So in an average month I can see myself able to keep 18k give or take. \n\nSo this is most of the information on that business I am wanting to put an offer up for. The sellers are asking $700k plus inventory. What are your guy's thoughts? Obviously I've done my research but wanting to ask from real people now.  \n\n",

This depends a lot on the area however - I'd expect more rural areas to stay gasoline-heavy for longer.\n\nIf you owned the land, I'd also be wary of having to pay the cleanup costs of removing all those underground tanks. Make sure this isn't on you to do if the business eventually ceases operating - it can cost six figures to do this.\n\nMy biggest concern is the rent. You have an amazing deal right now but do you have guarantees that they won't increase the rent by more than X% a year? If they make the rent reset to market rates, this whole deal isn't very good.\n\nAre there major repairs that need to be done? Check especially the condition of the tanks.\n\nThe labor costs seem low but I am in a state with a high minimum wage. Is this place running 24 hour?\n\nAre there opportunities for complementary businesses in the future? e.g. a car wash or a uhaul franchise?\n\nOverall though, the numbers look good ($700K for roughly $200K a year return) and everything passes the gut check.",

So say you’re grossing $20k/month (which is the right answer btw, your labour should go against direct expenses thus making your gross $24k/month),  \n\nGiven what you’ve said about the business, I would apply some nominal percent discount, I would say somewhere around 5%-10%. Wouldn’t pay more than $265,000\n\nThe other thing to consider is your labour. Are you going to be working there, or are you going to need to hire? What was your calculations on the 15k labour? If you are going to work, how many years are you expecting to do that, are you anticipating purchasing another gas station? All this should go into factoring your personal valuation for this business. \n\nAs for inventory, what is the inventory value? What was their inventory shrinkage last year? If you have a couple years of fiscal data, take the average of the last 3 years of inventory shrinkage and discount their inventory. \n\nAll being said, this business is netting around 10%, so a healthy business. Last thing I would check; what’s the nearest station, are your prices higher or lower, and what’s their proximity to major roads (freeways, etc.). If there’s opportunity to gain business then your discount as mentioned above changes.\n\nEDIT: 10% net is not taking into account owners expenses currently. Your real net, EBITDA, should be higher than 10% (at least I guess).",

No early-termination clause.\nThe scary parts of the lease:\n•  Article VIII – Can’t assign or sublet without landlord’s written consent (they can refuse for any reason) and I stay 100% liable anyway.\n•  Section 10.02(b) – If I default they can accelerate all remaining rent and make the whole balance due immediately.\n•  Personal Guaranty (pages 10–11) – Absolute, unconditional, survives LLC bankruptcy, they can sue me personally without ever going after the LLC first.\n\nPlan is to stop paying now, move out clean by end of January 2026, demand a one-page termination that releases the guaranty (or just drop the keys).\nRealistically, with an overseas owner and a broker who makes nothing until the space is re-rented, will they actually chase me personally for the last 5 months, or just keep the 2+ months they already have and move on?\nThanks.",

Orherwise known as the 4P's or the Marketing Mix.\n\nPrice - What's you price point? What are your margins?  Where does your pricing fall compare with your competition? etc.\n\nProduct- Is it a product or service?  Is it unique or a commodity,\n\nPromotion - Sales, Advertising.  Advertising and Sales fall under the Promotion element.\n\nPlace- Who is you product or service delivered\n\nDefining our Marketing Mix drives your strategy along with Market Research.

Marketing manager - as in you already have established channels, proven offer, dedicated infrastructure, etc., and need someone to keep it alive + report to you\n\n2. Marketing strategist - as in you've never performed marketing or your marketing isn't working as well as it should, and you need someone to format and enhance your marketing\n\n  \nWithout posting the job desc, there's no way to tell, but these are VERY different roles. Most businesses need option 2, because they think \"finding an ad guy\" is marketing. It is not, because marketing is input based, meaning if you don't have a solid foundation, then there's no point in ever marketing.\n\n  \nIf you are non-competitive, have no clear ICP/offer, or even understand that data is better then feels, then you are not ready to market. Ads and marketing are not some magic bullet that prints money; you need to get the background stuff right first:\n\nContent - What they see / visuals\n\nCopy - What you say / offer \n\nConversion - Where they go after the ad/landing page\n\nCustomer - Who you are going after / ICP\n\n  \nDo you have all 4 ready to go? Then you just need someone to 10X what you are already doing.\n\n[If not, start here.](https://youtu.be/pCX6Z51HRl8)",

My uncles then decided for me that I need capital to grow the business, so they gave me a loan. \nThe loan, not an investment, needed to be paid back first before any dividends and they took 60% of my company. \nI was so young, I didn’t really know anything and my parents agreed to the deal. My parents know nothing about business.\nSo, uncles took 60%, I kept 30% and my parents have 10%. \nThe money went to building software that was complete crap and added no value. The business is successful, but all thanks to me. They do give some good advice though. \nAs I’ve grown up, I’ve just learned and learned how bad this deal was and I’ve grown up with such resentment. But, I was always too scared to bring this up, as I didn’t want the family the have a falling out. \nI even have to rent the office from my uncle. \nSo, once when I was 20, I wanted to move offices to somewhere neutral, but I was told “No, because then we won’t be involved and help you”.\nI then brought up 5 years ago that I want to buy shares back and they thought I was greedy. Now 5 years later, last week, I brought it up again that I want to buy some shares. \nThey told me that they can never understand what I’m angry about. In the real world, when people are desperate for money, they would handle “far worse prostitution”, and that I got a good deal and that I need to do some soul searching and see that what I’ve been feeling is wrong and that I actually lucked out. \nThe thing is, I wasn’t desperate, I didn’t even WANT it. I never asked for the loan. \n\nThey asked me to go ask “real investors” of the world about the deal and see that I’m wrong about my feelings that I got the short end of the stick.\n\nSo, as part of the research, I’m asking the real investors of reddit. \n\nI don’t think anyone will agree that this is a fair deal. And I’ve approached some lawyers to help me navigate this, but, in the meantime, for my “soul searching”, please can you give me unbiased opinions, did I get a good deal?\n\nCan anyone give me some similar scenarios?",

Then propose a **structured** pathway: e.g., a staged buy-back at independently-valued prices; or converting part of their holding into non-voting equity; or refinancing their loan with a bank/third party so the company isn’t commercially dependent on them; or formalising their “involvement” as an advisory role paid at market, rather than enforced via share control and tenancy.

It’s also the most dangerous because you’re used to getting paid for *inputs* (code/hours), but business only pays for *outputs* (offers/sales).\n\nRegarding mentors: **Mentors don't push stalled cars.**\n\nThere’s a concept called the \"Push the Car\" principle. If you’re standing by a broken-down car waving for help, people drive by. If you’re sweating, pushing it uphill by yourself, people pull over to help.\n\nDon't look for a mentor to tell you *what* to do. Do the work, hit a wall, and then ask for help scaling the wall.\n\nSince you're starting fresh, follow the **Constraint-First** method so you don't burn your severance on stuff that doesn't matter:\n\n1. **Define Hard Constraints:** How many hours? What’s the budget? What do you *hate* doing? (If you hate sales, don't start a high-touch agency).\n2. **Market &gt; Product:** Don't build a website. Don't print business cards. Go find a group of people with a \"bleeding neck\" problem and ask if they'll pay you to fix it.\n3. **Sell, Then Build:** If you can't sell the concept to 5 people, the product isn't worth building.\n\nI actually built a system (Operator OS) to force myself through this exact logic because my \"tech brain\" kept trying to over-engineer complex solutions for problems nobody had. It forces me to validate the \"boring\" business fundamentals before I write a single line of code.\n\nGo get one stranger to pay you $1. That will teach you more than 100 coffee chats with \"mentors.\"\n\nAll the best.",

Make sure you do your research though, find a mentor who you think is best suited for you as far as goals and general business. \n\nI wouldn’t worry about the whole marketing and brand side of your business for now, I’d focus on creating a good product and take the time to start networking. Find groups that are in your industry or other similar businesses who do what you want to do because you can befriend them and go to them for any questions or ideas you might have. Just don’t go around telling everyone your ideas because you want to be the one to bring them to life, not someone else. \n\nI wasn’t laid off from my job but I’ve always dabbled in entrepreneurship and hustling the shit out of things lol I would also mention that it’s never going to be easy. You’re going to question yourself a lot and some choices will be hard to make at first but have faith that you’re making the right choice and if you don’t, learn from it and move forward. Have close friends and family help you out by mentioning to others what you’re trying to start. That’s free and simple marketing and possible referrals as well. \n\nI’m not sure what else you’re looking for as far as advice but if that’s what you want to do, go for it my dude. Don’t be left asking yourself “what if”, just get started and learn as you go. That’s basically what being an entrepreneur is like, you’re learning as you go but you’re also enhancing your skillsets and circle of people you have around you.",

A lot of small business owners focus on the idea, the branding, the product — but rarely on the risks that could blindside them later.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned over the years is that understanding your risks early is just as important as building the business itself. Even a simple awareness of “what could go wrong” helps you make better decisions and protects you from surprises that can derail everything.\n\nIt’s not about being pessimistic — it’s about preparing for the worst so you can operate confidently. Businesses that take the time to anticipate risks almost always end up more resilient, more stable, and less stressed when challenges come up.\n\nJust wanted to share that perspective because it’s often overlooked, but it makes a huge difference in the long run.",

          "body": "I can’t speak to getting laid off then going into business as I have always known I would be in business since I was a kid. Never really had a job. \n\nAnyway I think I can offer some insight. That said take with a grain of salt as the best I ever did was a software dev &amp; ad agency that at peak had 30 full time in office employees. But ultimately it went under. \n\nOkay so now that background is out of the way. A couple things. Firstly do not just pick the business around something you like. You need to first identify a gap in the market place that you can fill. Without this breaking through is very very difficult. Aka do your marketing research before registering your LLC. \n\nWhen hiring do not hire people like you. Meaning you want to hire people that are good at what you are bad at. As an example I made this mistake. My first c suite hire was a director of sales and marketing. I am VERY good at sales and marketing. So what happened was we sold A TON but then did not have a good operations person to help manage the new projects well. Typically the best c suite hires are people you may clash with a bit. \n\nNext do NOT compete on price. In any given market there is one winner in that game. The person who is priced the lowest. And trust me you do not want that kind of business. Instead focus on having by far the best value proposition and charge the most or close to the most. Target the upper part of the market. \n\nAs for types of business that you want to start. I’ll break down a few type and benefits. We will go in order from least amount of deployable leverage to most (the more leverage potential a business has the faster rate of growth there is, more leverage = more money for the same work input) \n\n\n1. Consulting/freelancing\nThis is just you selling your ability to work. Not very scalable but very low barrier to entry. \n\n2. Agency/service based business \nThis is a great option if you have technical skills and the ability to out sell what you alone can do. This is also great because the barrier to entry is very low still. It allows you to deploy some leverage by hiring other people to complete the work allowing you to sell more projects then if you had to sell the project then also complete the work. However it is still not a ton of leverage as the growth of the business is driven by selling more projects which means hiring more people. So the more you make the more you have to spend on employees and it’s pretty linear with that. \n\n3. A physical product business. This can be VERY profitable but barrier to entry is high. You must be able to manufacture product at scale and have distribution channels. This however can deploy VAST amounts of leverage as gaining investment (using other people’s money) is very normal here. Then you can scale close to exponentially as scaling manufacturing is a negligible cost when compared to sales growth if you do it right. The risk here is large and will require SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES to start. \n\n4. Lastly you have software. Software is by far the most leverage as you can sell basically infinite at very little increase of cost to you. This is why software companies are so popular for venture capital. They get huge multipliers on EBITA on market exit. However because of this it is INSANELY COMPETITIVE. \n\n\nAnyway I hope this helps. I’m far from hyper successful. I’m 32 and have had plenty of failures but I learned from them and each failure teaches more. Now I am bringing virtual production to live broadcasting in poker. Same way Fox NFL uses it. \n\nCheers man.",

If someone doesn’t like the price, isn’t it easier to just find a company that fits their budget instead of trying to negotiate with someone who’s already priced fairly?\n\nThis has been on my mind for a while.\n\nDo other small business owners experience this too?\n\nHow do you handle these types of customers?\n\n",

So 1 TV mounted is $xx.xx but if you pay for me to mount 3 TVs (maybe 4) you only pay $xx.xx which is 10% less than if you paid for each one individually 3 times. \n\nEven better, have a fairly set TV price, but upsell them on other mountings. Have something else to mount? Trophies, Taxidermied animals, Picture frames, curtains, shelves, etc. I’ll do that for 30% off. But that price is something different (higher margin ideally). \n\nYou may also want to consider unmounting/re-mounting services. Mention to the customer that you will gladly unmount any TVs when its time for them to move (apartment dwellers) and will give them a 15% discount when they want to re-mount at their new apartment. \n\nAlso, offer limited time deals for big TV seasons (Holidays when people watch Christmas movies, Halloween for Scary Movies, or Superbowl Season or March Madness, etc.)\n\nHope this helps!",
