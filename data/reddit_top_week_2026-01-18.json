      "selftext": "I bought a Chevrolet Colorado in July of last year with the intention of starting a side hustle. I considered doing landscaping, hauling junk, or even buying a vending machine. However, while browsing Facebook Marketplace, I came across a listing for a used throne chair. I decided to research how much these chairs typically rent for in other areas and what I could potentially charge if I bought one. Keep in mind, I had no prior experience in the party or event business.\n\nDespite that, I decided to take a chance, bought the chair, and posted it for rent. The post received a lot of views, but no bookings at first. Most businesses in my area charge around $150 to rent a throne chair, plus a delivery fee, which usually brings the total to $180–$200. Since I wasn’t getting much interest, I decided to lower my price from $150 to $120, which also includes delivery within 30 minutes of where I live.\n\nAfter about 3.5 weeks and spending roughly $760, I honestly started to think buying the throne chair had been a bad idea. However, just a couple of days after lowering the price, I received my first booking—then my second, third, and so on. As bookings picked up, I eventually purchased a second throne chair for about the same price, except this one was brand new.\n\nFrom the end of August through the end of December, I made a little over $1,500. While most of that money went toward paying off the chairs, it became clear that there is a lot of potential in this type of business. Along the way, I’ve connected with people from schools, event coordinators, venue owners, and other local businesses.\n\nMy goal for this year is to make over $4,000. While that may not sound like a lot, it’s relatively easy money. The hardest part of the job is loading the chairs onto the truck and properly taking care of them. I make sure to clean them after every event and use bubble wrap on the corners and other important areas that could be easily damaged. I also purchased a tarp and stretch wrap to protect the chairs from dirt during delivery or while they’re waiting for the next booking.\n\nMy next goal is to add a bench throne and a 360 photo booth to the business. We’ll see what the future holds.",

Right now its capped because of time, not demand, and that matters.\n\nThe real question is this: can you remove yourself from the hours. If income only goes up when you personally tutor more, then going full time just means longer days and more stress, not scale.\n\nBefore quitting I would try one thing first. Use the job as a safety net and test leverage. Hire one tutor. Raise prices slightly. Productise something. If you can push it past the current ceiling without doubling your hours, then you have something real.\n\nAlso worth saying, last year being tougher is a warning sign. You dont want to jump just as demand softens. Build a buffer. Prove 50k plus is repeatable, not a good year.\n\nIf it still works with less you involved, then yeah, different convo. Otherwise its just a very good side hustle.",

They say it’s a little extra incentive to spend time with the dogs and keep them happy, and it works lol.\n\nI kinda lucked into it though. Had a trip to visit my dad planned and my dad told his best friend who still lives near me, and he spontaneously bought a ticket on the same flight as me which was cool.

          "body": "as a college student juggling classes, research, and extracurriculars, it's understandable that you’re looking for a side hustle that doesn’t demand too much time or stress. dropshipping can be a bit hit or miss, especially for someone with a packed schedule, since it often requires a lot of upfront effort in marketing, finding reliable suppliers, and dealing with customer service. instead, you might consider side hustles that leverage your existing skills or require less ongoing commitment. one option is freelance work, where you can offer services like writing, editing, or graphic design, depending on what you’re good at. websites like Upwork or Fiverr allow you to pick up small gigs based on your availability. tutoring is another great option, especially if you’re strong in a specific subject like math or coding. you can tutor other students or even offer online tutoring through platforms like Chegg or Wyzant. if you enjoy content creation, consider starting a YouTube channel or a blog about something you're passionate about this could turn into passive income through ads or affiliate marketing over time. additionally, selling digital products such as printables, templates, or online courses can generate income with little ongoing work once you create the product. ultimately, the best side hustle is one that fits seamlessly into your schedule without adding too much pressure. look for something that allows you to work on your own terms and doesn’t interfere with your main priorities like school or competitions.",

Last week my dad asked for something he thought could make his workflow easier. So I built a simple QR tracking system for his company (plus a couple of extra features). It’s just a basic MVP, no landing page, no real auth (only invite-based access), no polish. But it does what it’s supposed to do.\n\nAnd unexpectedly, 3 other companies reached out asking if they could also use it. I ended up selling all of them a yearly plan ($199/y).\n\nI’ve never experienced something like this before. We grind constantly, try to follow best practices, iterate, polish, try to post a banger tweet or whatever… And yet this simple, single-purpose, not-very-fancy product somehow sells itself. It’s wild. I always see posts saying “it’s not the product, it’s distribution,” and I’m sure they’re right for my game dev products, but in this case things played out differently.\n\nI guess sometimes solving one real problem for someone is enough. I need to remind myself of that.",

There's something satisfying about seeing a driveway go from grimy to clean in real-time. You're outside, moving around, and you can literally see your progress.\nThe people interaction is actually one of the best parts. Most customers are homeowners who want to chat - about their house, their yard plans, neighborhood stuff. Just honest conversations.in my experience, not Zoom fatigue. And when they see the results, they get genuinely excited. My biggest surprise: the business side is way less screen-heavy than I expected. I do some online booking/invoicing, but it's maybe 30 minutes of admin for every 3-4 hours of actual work.\nIf you want purely hands-on, look at services where the \"done\" is obvious: pressure washing, lawn care, house cleaning, gutters, pool cleaning, junk removal. People love seeing the before/after in person. Satisfying for both them and me.",

Things like setting up GA4 properly, cleaning up dashboards, or explaining where traffic or conversions are leaking. Small ecommerce brands especially struggle with this and will pay for clarity.\n\nAnother angle is freelance reporting or dashboard builds. Many founders don’t want complex models, they just want a simple weekly or monthly view that answers “what’s working and what isn’t.” That’s a fast win if you know SQL, Looker, Power BI, or Tableau.\n\nSome go the data audit or tracking setup route. Reviewing event tracking, pixels, attribution, and fixing broken data. It’s boring work for founders but high value.\n\nLonger term, people turn their experience into templates, tools, or micro products like dashboards, attribution spreadsheets, or cohort analysis templates and sell those repeatedly instead of trading time.\n\nThe common thread is that the money usually comes from translating data into decisions, not just running numbers.

On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns.\n\nToday I keep P2P as a single-digit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding.\n\n I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure.",

Not because I'm generous, but because I'm lazy.\n\nYou know the drill: You're on a call, and the client asks, \"Hey, can we just add a small blog section?\"\n\nI knew I should charge for it. But the thought of hanging up, logging into my CRM (HoneyBook/PandaDoc), cloning a proposal, editing a 5-page PDF, and sending a scary formal contract felt like way too much friction for a small task. So I’d usually just say, \"Sure, I'll take care of it.\"\n\nI built Rider to fix this. It’s not a CRM replacement; it’s specifically for that \"messy middle\" of a project where scope creep happens.\n\nMy new workflow:\n\nClient asks for extra work.\n\nI stay on the call and open Rider.\n\nI type: \"Extra Blog Page - $100\".\n\nI paste the link in the chat (can also be emailed from within Rider).\n\nThey click \"Approve\" (and can pay right there).\n\nThe whole thing takes 30 seconds. No awkwardness, no \"I'll send a proposal later,\" just locked-in revenue.\n\nI'm currently beta testing this to see if it's a viable business or just a tool for myself. I would strictly love roasts/feedback on the flow if anyone has a sec to check it out. Drop a comment below if you want an invite.",

      "selftext": "Created a PDF guide 6 months ago. Built a simple landing page with AI. Set up automated payment and delivery. Haven't touched it since. Still making $350/month.\n\n# The Setup\n\n**Step 1: Find a problem** Scrolled through Facebook groups and Reddit in \\[niche\\]. Found a problem people kept asking about repeatedly.\n\n**Step 2: Create the PDF** Took 1 hour to write a comprehensive guide solving that specific problem. Used AI to help format and structure it. Nothing fancy - just clear solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Build a landing page** Used an AI website builder (just gave it a prompt like \"create a landing page to sell a PDF about X\"). Took 1 hour to get it looking right. Added:\n\n* Headline describing the problem\n* What's inside the PDF\n* Price ($9)\n* Stripe payment button\n* Automated email delivery after purchase\n\n**Step 4: Post it once** Dropped it in a few relevant communities where people have that problem. Got initial traction.\n\n**Step 5: Forget about it** All sales now come from:\n\n* Word of mouth\n* People searching for solutions\n* Zero marketing from me\n\n# Why this works\n\n* One-time effort (2 hours total)\n* AI makes both PDF and landing page creation fast\n* Stripe + automated email = no manual work\n* Low price point ($9) = easy impulse buy\n* Solves real problem = people pay\n\n# The numbers\n\n* Initial work: 1 hour creating PDF + 1 hour for landing page\n* Ongoing work: 0 hours/month\n* Monthly revenue: $350/month\n* Startup cost: $0\n* Tech stack: AI tools + Stripe + automated email\n\n# The truth about \"passive\"\n\nFirst month required some marketing. After that, truly passive. Sales happen automatically from organic discovery.\n\nSmall niche = limited scale. But $350/month for 2 hours of work isn't bad.\n\n# For anyone wanting to try this\n\n1. Find a problem people actively search for solutions to\n2. Create a clear, actionable PDF with AI help (don't overthink it)\n3. Use AI to build a simple landing page (literally just describe what you want)\n4. Set up Stripe payment + automated delivery\n5. Post in 2-3 relevant places\n6. Let organic discovery take over\n\nThe key: solve a real problem people are already looking for answers to.",

I see one problem with this - competition.  All these methods have one thing in common - they work on theory but they don't work in real life.  You have to heavily promote , spam and probably pay for fb ads. Today there are only a few methods that work - I am afraid this is not one of them. This method would need to have a kw research, seo optimization throughout the text and landing page and it takes way more than two hours.

Plus the marketing part such as ads or even organic traffic isn't going to turn to success on it's own. \n\nAll these posts of people making 6 figures with AI or digital marketing are too exaggerated and clickbait. I get it they do it for controversy, views and engagement, etc..But it's really annoying and makes people question everything!\n\nAnd by the time you find something interesting or worth trying out, you are already too burned out and afraid of falling for the same scam yet again.\n\nFrom my own personal research of building digital products both PDF, E-book and courses, I can easily say just from building part you have like 30 steps that you have to go through one way or the other. And just to mention that marketing and promoting comes as an extra steps on top of it all.\n\nSo, while some people got lucky and made their first few sale's with only Chatgpt most of us spend ton of time and money doing it properly. I am not saying here you can't make money without investing money or spending the least amount of time on your products but I am saying those are rare situations where people actually make it that way. \n\nJust for reference the proper way of selling digital products online include:\n1. Researching the audience/demand \n2. Researching the competition (competitor brands, business, agency's, etc...)\n3. Figuring out your product (everything from what product is supposed to be, what problems it solves and how it transformers people or their situation, etc...)\n4. Product creation (How to write, film or design your product, how to edit and put together everything, what tools you need to do all that, etc...)\n5. Figuring out market channels (where are you going to sell your product, how are you going to package it, which format, paid or free advertising or both, etc...)\n6. Content Creation if using free traffic or Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Google ads if using Paid Advertising. \n7. Consistency &amp; Growth (How are you going to connect everything and make it sustainable and long term without losing traction and how to scale it later on)\n\nAnd these are just some of the things that real business owners and content creators have to know and be able to use to reach that success that everyone has been bragging about. If we really wanted to go all in there are all kinds of important stuff still needed like AI understanding, SEO, Email Marketing, Social Media Marketing, etc... \n\nP.S This post is from my own personal experience and research that I have been doing for last 10 years. (You don't need everything but the more you know it easier becomes!)",

She told her friend at church about it and next thing I know I have 3 more people asking me to do it.\n\nI bought a decent video capture device on Amazon (the Elgato one, around $80) and started posting on local Facebook groups. Turns out theres SO many boomers and gen x folks who have boxes of old tapes, camcorder videos, and even those weird mini DV tapes sitting in their garage that they want digitized but have no idea how to do it.\n\nI charge $15 per tape for VHS and $20 for camcorder tapes cause they take a bit longer. Most people have like 10 to 30 tapes so the jobs add up quick. December was insane cause everyone wanted them done before the holidays, made around $950 that month. Its slowed down a bit now but still getting steady work.\n\nI can literally just let the tapes run while I'm working my regular job from home or watching TV. I also upload everything to a google drive folder for them and burn it to a DVD if they want (extra $5). Some people tip really well too cause they get emotional seeing their old family videos.\n\nNow I actually have $2k set aside from Stаke, but I'm kinda stuck on how to scale this up beyond just me doing it. I can only run like 2 or 3 tapes at a time with my current setup. Anyone have ideas on how to grow this without it turning into a full time thing? Or should I just keep it small and steady?",

          "body": "This is actually a really solid little business, and you stumbled into it the best way possible: by solving a real, emotional problem people already care about.\n\nA few things stand out to me. First, the demand you’re seeing isn’t a fad. People aren’t suddenly *creating* more VHS tapes, but the urgency is real because those tapes are literally degrading every year. Add the emotional angle and holidays, and you’ve got something people are happy to pay for and even tip on. That’s rare.\n\nOn scaling, the key is not trying to turn this into some startup-looking thing. The moment you do, it becomes stressful. The simplest way to grow without burning yourself out is parallelization. More capture devices, more VCRs, and a slightly better workflow so you can run 5–8 tapes at once instead of 2–3. That’s boring advice, but it works. Your time doesn’t really increase, throughput does.\n\nAnother option is raising prices slightly or adding “convenience” upsells. Faster turnaround, pickup/drop-off, better labeling, cloud + physical backup bundles. You’re not just selling digitization, you’re selling peace of mind and nostalgia, and people pay for that. Especially the same demographic you’re already serving.\n\nIf you want to keep it part-time, I’d avoid hiring or expanding too fast. Managing people and other people’s mistakes is what turns a chill side hustle into a headache. Keeping it small and reliable is a feature, not a flaw.\n\nThe biggest green flag here is that customers are emotional and grateful. That usually means you’re doing something right and you’re priced reasonably, maybe even a bit low. I’d optimize for calm, steady income and low stress rather than “scaling” in the startup sense.\n\nSometimes the best businesses are the ones that quietly print money and don’t demand your soul. This sounds like one of those.",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** I got laid off in late 2024, saw a post on this subreddit about ElevenLabs voice cloning, and thought \"why not.\" 13 months later, I have 8 AI voice clones earning me over $1,000/month while I sleep. This is the detailed guide I wish I had when I started. I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Numbers–No Clickbait Here\n\nLet me just get this out of the way:\n\n- **Total earned to date:** $8,985\n- **Current monthly earnings:** ~$1,160/month\n- **Number of voices:** 8\n- **Time invested per month now:** Maybe 1-2 hours (checking stats, occasionally tweaking things)\n- **Full portfolio breakdown PDF (with earnings screenshots):** [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QpjMjdh4MU4vIadC6ZjSYqKWwhF4Puf2/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nI'm sharing my actual numbers because I've seen too many low-effort posts on this sub that say \"you can make money with AI voices!\" and then provide zero details. That's not helpful. This guide is going to be long, but by the end, you'll know exactly how to do this yourself.\n\n---\n\n## My Story\n\nIn late 2024, I got laid off. Not ideal, but I suddenly had time to explore side income ideas I'd been bookmarking for months.\n\nI stumbled across a post on this very subreddit about licensing your voice on ElevenLabs. The concept was simple: record your voice, upload it to their platform, and get paid every time someone uses it for their projects (YouTube videos, audiobooks, apps, whatever).\n\nI have a background in audio engineering, so I figured I had a slight edge. But honestly, the technical barrier is way lower than I expected. If you can follow instructions and speak clearly into a microphone, you can do this.\n\nI created my first voice, and within a few weeks, I was making a couple hundred dollars. I immediately created another. Then another.\n\n**Here's what most posts don't tell you: the real strategy is building a portfolio of voices, not just one.**\n\nMy top-performing voice averages $308/month. But I have another that only makes $16/month. If I'd stopped at one voice and it happened to be the $16 one, I probably would've given up and told everyone this doesn't work.\n\nInstead, I kept going. Now I have 8 voices across different categories, and the portfolio as a whole is what makes this a legit income stream.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Voice Cloning? Let me explain.\n\nElevenLabs is an AI company that offers text-to-speech technology. Users can type text and have it spoken aloud by AI voices.\n\nHere's where you come in: ElevenLabs has a Voice Library where creators can upload their voice clones and license them to other users. Every time someone uses your voice to generate audio, you get paid.\n\n**Who uses these voices?**\n\n- YouTubers and content creators\n- Audiobook producers\n- App developers\n- Podcasters\n- Game developers\n- Businesses making training videos\n- People creating voiceovers for social media\n\nThe demand is massive and growing. AI-generated voiceovers are everywhere now, and people need high-quality, natural-sounding voices.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Need Before Starting\n\n### The Essentials:\n\n1. **A decent microphone.** You don't need a $500 setup. A solid USB condenser mic like the Audio-Technica AT2020 (~$100) or even the Fifine K669B (~$30) can work. The key is clarity, not expense.\n\n2. **A quiet recording space.** This matters more than your mic. A closet full of clothes actually makes a great recording booth. You want minimal echo and no background noise (no AC humming, no traffic, no roommates).\n\n3. **Basic audio software.** Audacity is free and works great. GarageBand if you're on Mac. I personally use Pro Tools, but that's overkill for this.\n\n4. **30+ minutes of high-quality audio.** This is ElevenLabs' minimum requirement for a Professional Voice Clone. More on what to record later.\n\n5. **An ElevenLabs Creator Plan.** That's $22/month ($11 for your first month with the 50% discount). This is your only ongoing cost. [More on this below]\n\n### Optional But Helpful:\n\n- A pop filter (~$10) to reduce plosive sounds (harsh \"P\" and \"B\" sounds)\n- A mic stand or boom arm to keep positioning consistent\n- Basic knowledge of audio editing (removing breaths, normalizing levels)\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your ElevenLabs Account\n\nHead to ElevenLabs and create an account. Here's my link: https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones\n\nIt takes you straight to the pricing page where you can grab 50% off your first month. If this guide saves you from the 13 months of trial and error it took me to figure all this out, using the link is an easy way to say thanks. I get a small kickback at no extra cost to you.\n\n**Important:** You need the Creator Plan (minimum $22/month after month 1) to create Professional Voice Clones. ElevenLabs has a free tier and a Starter Plan, but unfortunately you can't create Professional voice clones with either of them.\n\nAlso, here's something most guides don't mention: **Each Creator Plan account only allows ONE Professional Voice Clone.**\n\nThey offer a Business plan which allows up to 3 Professional Voice Clones, but they charge $1,320/month for that… ridiculous. I know.\n\nSo, if you want to build a portfolio like I did (which I highly recommend), you'll need to create multiple accounts. Each account is $22/month with the Creator Plan, but even a mediocre voice should earn enough to cover that cost within a few weeks. My worst-performing voice still makes ~$16/month, and most of mine pay for themselves many times over.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The Most Important Part: Record Your Audio\n\nYou need at least 30 minutes of clean, high-quality audio. But here's what nobody tells you:\n\n**What you record matters as much as how you record it.**\n\nThe AI learns your voice patterns, inflections, and style from your recording. If you record yourself reading a novel in a calm, steady narration voice, your clone will sound great for audiobooks but weird for energetic social media content.\n\n**Match your recording to your intended use case:**\n\n| If you want your voice used for... | Record yourself... |\n|:--|:--|\n| Audiobooks / Narration | Reading fiction or non-fiction passages |\n| Podcasts | Having a conversational monologue |\n| Meditation / Relaxation | Speaking slowly and soothingly |\n| YouTube explainers | Explaining topics in an engaging way |\n| Character voices | Doing the character consistently |\n\n### Recording Tips:\n\n1. **Stay consistent.** Same mic position, same distance, same room, same energy level throughout.\n\n2. **Avoid mouth sounds.** Stay hydrated. Do a few takes if you get clicky mouth sounds.\n\n3. **Leave room tone.** Record 10 seconds of silence (just the room) at the start. This helps with noise removal later.\n\n4. **Don't over-edit.** Light noise removal is fine, but heavy processing can confuse the AI. Keep it natural.\n\n5. **Aim for -6dB to -3dB peaks.** Not too quiet, not clipping. Audacity has a great normalizing feature for this.\n\n6. **Record more than 30 minutes.** I usually aim for 45-60 minutes of raw audio, which gives me 30+ minutes of clean, edited content.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create Your Professional Voice Clone\n\nOnce you have your audio files ready:\n\n1. Click \"Voices\" in the left sidebar\n2. Click \"Create or Clone a Voice\"\n3. Select \"Professional Voice Clone\"\n4. Accept the terms\n\nNow you'll need to:\n\n**Name your voice.** Pick something memorable and fitting. \"Calm Sarah\" or \"Energetic Mike\" tells users what to expect better than \"Voice_Final_v2.\"\n\n**Write a description.** Be specific about what your voice is good for. Example: \"A warm, friendly American male voice perfect for explainer videos, podcasts, and corporate narration. Clear articulation with a conversational tone.\"\n\n**Add tags.** These are crucial for discoverability. Just click through the dropdowns to find the most relevant options for your voice.\n\n**Upload your audio.** You can upload multiple files. Make sure they total at least 30 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verify Your Voice\n\nElevenLabs requires voice verification to prove you're uploading your own voice (not stealing someone else's).\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. ElevenLabs generates a random sentence\n2. You record yourself reading it\n3. Their AI compares your verification recording to your uploaded audio\n4. If they match, you're verified\n\nThis is where most people mess up. The verification is picky. Here's how to pass it on the first try:\n\n- **Do it right after recording.** Stuff like humidity, sleep, or too much coffee can change your voice tone just enough to mess up the verification.\n- **Use the exact same setup.** Same mic, same room, same distance, same position.\n- **Match your energy.** If your uploaded audio was calm, verify calmly. If it was energetic, bring that energy.\n- **You only get a few attempts.** Too many failures and you'll get locked out temporarily.\n\n**Pro tip:** If you're using audio processing (EQ, compression, etc.) on your uploaded recordings, you'll want that same processing on your verification recording.\n\nI use a free tool called BlackHole (Mac) to route my DAW's processed output back into the verification recording. This way, my verification sounds identical to my uploaded audio. If you're on Windows, VoiceMeeter does the same thing.\n\nOnce submitted, the voice takes 2-6 hours to process. You'll get an email when it's ready.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Killer Voice Preview\n\nThis is your sales pitch. When users browse the Voice Library, they'll hear a short preview of each voice. You want yours to stand out.\n\n1. Go to Voices → My Voices\n2. Click the \"a\" icon to generate speech with your voice\n3. Create a preview that's 70-150 characters (aim for close to 150)\n\n**Two approaches:**\n\n**Option A: Speak directly to the listener**\n\n&gt; \"Hey there! I'm Jake, and I'm here to make your content sound amazing. Whether it's a podcast, YouTube video, or audiobook, let's create something great together.\"\n\n**Option B: Demonstrate your voice's purpose**\n\n&gt; \"The morning mist rolled across the valley as she opened the letter, her hands trembling with anticipation. Today would change everything.\"\n\n**Dial in the settings:**\n\nPlay with the sliders (speed, stability, exaggeration) and generate multiple versions until you get one that sounds natural and represents your voice well.\n\n**Important:** As of now, you can only use V2 voice models for previews. I've had the best results with \"Eleven Multilingual v2.\" I think it sounds closest to the original voice.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Publish to the Voice Library\n\nTime to go live:\n\n1. Click the three dots (⋮) next to your voice\n2. Click \"Share voice\"\n3. Toggle \"Sharing\" to ON\n4. Toggle \"Publish to the Voice Library\" to ON\n\n**Note:** If you use a VPN, turn it off for this step. The sharing toggle sometimes doesn't appear with VPNs enabled. Weird bug, but it got me stuck for an hour.\n\n**Settings to configure:**\n\n- **Live moderation** prevents your voice from being used for adult content. Disabling it maximizes earnings potential (more users can access your voice), but it's a personal choice.\n\n- **Custom Voice Preview** is where you select your best generation from Step 5.\n\n- **Notice Period** determines how long existing users can keep using your voice after you remove it. Longer notice periods mean higher revenue share. I recommend 6 months or more.\n\n- **Submit your voice name.** Follow ElevenLabs' naming format. You can't change this later, so make it count.\n\nAfter submission, a human (I think) reviews your voice. During business hours, approval usually takes less than 24 hours. Weekend submissions might wait until Monday.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Set Up Payouts\n\nYou need to connect a bank account to get paid:\n\n1. Click your profile picture (top right)\n2. Click \"Payouts\"\n3. Click \"Create payout account\"\n4. Follow the prompts to set up Stripe Express\n\nPayouts happen weekly. You can watch your earnings accumulate in real-time on the Payouts page.\n\n**Tax note for US folks:** ElevenLabs doesn't withhold taxes. They'll send you a 1099-MISC at year end. Set aside money for taxes. I put away about 25-30% of my voice earnings just to be safe. You can also write off the subscription fees as a deduction, so make sure to keep receipts!\n\n---\n\n## The Strategy That 10x'd My Earnings\n\nOkay, you've got one voice live. Here's how to actually make real money:\n\n### Build a Portfolio\n\nOne voice is a lottery ticket. A portfolio is a strategy.\n\nMy 8 voices span different categories:\n\n- Meditation / Calm (my top earner at ~$309/month)\n- Narration (2 voices, ~$120/month combined)\n- Conversational / Podcast (~$110/month)\n- Character voices (~$100/month)\n- ASMR (2 newer voices, too early to judge)\n\n**Why multiple voices?**\n\n- Different users search for different things. Your voice might be perfect for multiple categories, but each voice can only have one primary category.\n- Hedges your bets. If one voice flops, others might carry you.\n- Compounds over time. 8 voices earning $100/month beats 1 voice earning $300/month.\n\n### \"But I only have one voice!\"\n\nNo, you have many. Try:\n\n- Different pitch ranges (speak higher, speak lower)\n- Different energy levels (calm vs. energetic)\n- Different speeds (slow and deliberate vs. quick and punchy)\n- Different personas (professional vs. casual vs. warm vs. authoritative)\n- Character voices if you can do them\n\nEach variation = new voice = new account = new income stream.\n\n### Reverse-Engineer What Works\n\nBefore creating a new voice, I research:\n\n1. Go to the Voice Library \"Explore\" tab\n2. Search keywords for your intended niche (e.g., \"meditation,\" \"podcast,\" \"narration\")\n3. Look at the top-performing voices\n4. Study their names, descriptions, tags, and previews\n5. Note what they're doing well\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n- What keywords are they using?\n- How do they describe the voice?\n- What does their preview say/do?\n- Is this niche saturated or underserved?\n\nThen create a voice that fits the proven formula while adding your own twist. Don't copy, but definitely learn from winners.\n\n### Optimize Everything\n\n- **Tags matter.** Use all the relevant ones. Think about what users would search.\n- **Description matters.** Be specific and benefit-focused.\n- **Preview matters.** Make those 150 characters count.\n- **Voice quality matters.** Better recordings = better clones = more usage.\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Expectations\n\nLet me be honest about what to expect:\n\n**Month 1:** You'll probably make somewhere between $10-50. Don't be discouraged. The algorithm needs time to surface your voice to users.\n\n**Months 2-3:** If your voice is decent and well-tagged, you should see growth. $50-150/month is reasonable.\n\n**Months 4+:** Things stabilize. You'll have a sense of whether a voice is a winner or underperformer.\n\n**My portfolio breakdown:**\n\n| Tier | Voices | Avg Monthly | % of Revenue |\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n| Top performer (&gt;$250/mo) | 1 | $309 | 27% |\n| Strong ($100-150/mo) | 3 | $111 | 36% |\n| Moderate ($50-100/mo) | 1 | ~$100 | 9% |\n| Underperforming (&lt;$50/mo) | 1 | $16 | 1% |\n| Too new to judge | 2 | TBD | - |\n\nNot every voice will be a home run. That's fine. The portfolio approach smooths out the variance.\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Do I need professional audio experience?**\n\nNo. I have it, and it helps, but I've seen people with basic setups do well. Clean audio in a quiet room matters more than expensive gear.\n\n**How much time does this take?**\n\nUpfront: Maybe 2-5 hours per voice (recording, editing, uploading, optimizing). Ongoing: Almost none. I check my stats (and bank account) every few weeks. It's genuinely passive.\n\n**Is the market saturated?**\n\nThere are a lot of voices, but demand is growing fast. The key is finding your niche. Generic \"male narrator\" is crowded. \"Soothing meditation guide\" or \"energetic Gen-Z explainer\" is less so.\n\n**Can I do this outside the US?**\n\nYes! ElevenLabs pays creators worldwide via Stripe. Tax implications vary by country, so check your local laws.\n\n**What if my voice gets rejected?**\n\nMake sure your audio quality is good and your verification matches your uploaded content. I've never had a rejection, so I can't speak to the appeals process.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Start Checklist\n\nIf you want to get started today:\n\n- Sign up for ElevenLabs Creator Plan\n- Set up your recording space (quiet room, mic, software)\n- Record 30-45 minutes of audio (match your intended use case)\n- Edit lightly (remove mistakes, normalize levels)\n- Create Professional Voice Clone\n- Pass verification (same setup as recording!)\n- Generate preview (max 150 characters)\n- Publish to Voice Library\n- Set up Stripe payouts\n- Repeat with new voices to build portfolio\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nThis isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. It took me 13 months to get to $1,160/month, and I put real effort into building and optimizing my portfolio.\n\nBut here's what I love about it:\n\n- **It's genuinely passive.** I haven't touched most of my voices in months.\n- **It scales.** More voices means more income streams.\n- **Low startup cost.** $11 for your first month, basic mic, free software.\n- **Growing market.** AI voice usage is exploding.\n\n**Ready to start building your voice portfolio?** Here's my affiliate link: https://try.elevenlabs.io/earn-with-voice-clones\n\nYou get 50% off your first month and everything I learned in 13 months about turning this into $1k+/month. I get a small referral bonus. We all win. Seriously, good luck. Drop questions in the comments if you get stuck. I'll try to answer as many as I can.\n\nNow go make some money! 🎤",

A couple hundred bucks a month is very doable *right now*, even without pro audio experience. That said, more people are catching on, so this probably won’t be wide open forever.  \nPeople tend to overcomplicate the setup. At its core it’s really just:\n\n1. Sign up for [Elevenlabs](https://share.google/YX0r067VkJEGa0KHz)\n2. Choose the Creator Plan\n3. Upload a clean voice sample (30 mins minimum — honestly 2–3 hours is even better)\n4. Pass the voice captcha (verification)\n5. Toggle Shared + Discovery in Voice Library\n6. Wait \\~1–2 days for approval\n\nYou’re basically licensing your voice like a voice actor. Users grab your voice for audiobooks, YouTube shorts, explainers, etc., and you get paid every time it’s used. No outreach, no client management.  \nCharacterization matters more than people realize. Slight pitch, pacing, or energy changes can make the same voice feel totally different  and those variations often perform better than a generic “narrator” voice.\n\nAlso appreciate you being upfront about expectations and portfolio strategy that’s where most people go wrong thinking one voice is enough for $1000/month.",

Do you think you are just lucky, have a knack for knowing what people are searching for, or that your experience is giving you a leg up (or a combination of these things)? Or do you think it's very likely that anyone would at least make a little if they tried this (and did a decent job, obviously)?",

What income streams were worth the initial investment of time or money? Which ones ended up being more active than expected?  \n  \nI’m open to things like online businesses, digital products, investing, or other side hustles that can coexist with full-time work.

          "body": "I'm in a similar boat, full-time job but I've managed to build up a few income streams on the side.  \nMy main passive income comes from dividend investing. I've been consistently putting money into dividend-paying stocks and ETFs over the past few years, and now I'm at the point where I'm getting a few hundred dollars quarterly without doing anything. The key was starting early and being consistent with contributions, even if they were small at first. It took about 2-3 years before it felt \"real,\" but now it genuinely requires zero maintenance beyond occasional portfolio rebalancing.\n\nFor semi-passive stuff, I also do side hustles when I have free time. I use Freecash to pick up some extra money during lunch breaks or when I'm watching TV. It's not life-changing money, but it's nice beer money for tasks that take minimal effort. The beauty of it is I can do it whenever I want, no commitment.\n\nMy advice: Start with something that requires minimal ongoing decisions (like index fund investing) and layer on active side hustles as your schedule allows. The combination has worked well for me because the passive stuff grows in the background while I can scale the active stuff up or down based on how busy work gets.  \nHappy to answer any questions if you want more details!",

Once a workflow is set up, it becomes semi-hands-off in the sense that you’re not constantly reinventing things.\n\nThings like maintaining systems, updating content or data, handling overflow admin or support tasks. It’s not exciting, but it’s predictable, and a lot of it turns into recurring work with the same clients.\n\nOver time, that’s what gave me leverage and optionality.

          "body": "Honestly you already have the right mindset. Most so called passive income takes real upfront effort and only becomes more hands off later if you stick with it long enough.\n\nI work with a financial services firm called Revolution Financial Management and what I have seen work best for people with full time jobs is treating something new as a parallel build rather than expecting quick passive results. It is not instant and it is not hands off in the beginning, but it can realistically scale over time and become more flexible once systems and clients are in place.\n\nWhat tends to work well is starting it alongside a normal nine to five, setting clear boundaries on time, and letting it grow gradually instead of forcing it to replace income too quickly. Some people keep it supplemental long term and others eventually lean into it more once it proves itself.\n\nIt may be worth exploring alongside things like investing or digital products if your goal is something that can coexist with full time work and potentially become more hands off later. Happy to explain what it actually looks like in practice if you are curious. No pressure at all.",

      "selftext": "So right now I make roughly between $857-$900/month renting out washers and dryers COMPLETLEY remotley.\n\nI've never seen these washers and dryers in person EVER, or even know HOW to operate a washer/dryer (yes i'm a screenager).\n\nSo I saw this video on youtube from this youtube channel that was interviewing this dude that makes like 50k/month renting out washers and dryers (revenue only) but he does all of the maintence/repairs and delivery so his margins are pretty high. If i had to guess he probably inflated his numbers in some way to sell a shiny object syndrome dream because he has a skool community course that he sells but the business that he operates is for sure profitable.\n\nThe other caviot is that he has his own trailor/scrap yard for storage/hauling, and used to work as a dryer/washer repair tech so all of his repairs are \"free\" (done by him). I don't have any of that but I could defintley afford it (I have 57k in savings from other side hustles and some luck).\n\nThe whole video wasn't SUPER helpful, besides the facebook marketplace segment, where the guy showcases how he does his FREE organic advertising on facebook to do 50k/month in RV, and as someone who has multiple accounts on facebook listing washer and dryer rentals, I can vouch that I get over 30+ inquiries a day from 5 facebook account and don't usually have time/forget to respond to prospects. (im in texas)\n\nSince I didnt have a truck or storage unit, I cold called a few washer and dryer wholesellers on google maps and worked out an agreement, I know its a killer deal but he charges me $400 for a SET of washers and dryers (amanas and whirlpools), and $50 to INSTALL them. (Yes I've been told by many people that this is a crazy deal), and he also doesn't charge me for storage if anyone ever defaults and I have no where else to send my washers and dryers too.\n\nRight now, I've been sitting on a set of 6 washers and dryers and do a \"rent to own\" business model, in which most people default out of. Here are my payment options:\n\n$104/month rent to own for 12 months (nobody gets this)\n\n$80/month rent to own for 18 months (8 people have this)\n\n$65/month rent to own for 24 months (2 people have this)\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that people DO screw you over in this business model, but it usually is not TOO terrible.\n\nThe only time I have been screwed over is when I had a few people sign a contract for a 1 or 2 year lease on the washer or dryer and they default after the FIRST month because they ran out of money (which is destined in this market segment), or they bought their own washer and dryer (wtf???)\n\nSo another thing I do is charge DOUBLE the security deposit, so if someone asks for $80/month, I charge them $160 for delivery and install (everything is through stripe). This obviously leads to fewer conversions but there are still ALOT of people out there that will be more than willing to pay $160 for the delivery and install. ($80 one time payment, $80 reccuring payment). This removes all risk for THIS instance because my maximum downside is $100 ($50 for the install and $50 for my delivery guy to remove it). Obviously there is a risk of them just \"stealing\" the washer and dryer, which is ALOT more likley because of the targeted market segment (low income people).\n\nI've never gotten a washer or dryer \"stolen\", it's just not something that happens, but if it does happen, I told each customer that I have a kill switch on them (I don't but I'm sure this deters them from doing so)however I know this is defintely NOT full proof and I am brainstorming a solution. (I'm sure its not super hard to set up). I've cycled through 18 people over the course of the last 5 months, and as I said earlier, I still profit $60 even if I get screwed on the first month.\n\nI've been doing this for 5 months now so my sets JUST broke even (not by that much), so next month will be my first month of REAL profit.\n\nHere is my \"funnel\" or so you call it.\n\nCustomer reaches out on facebook marketplace ---&gt; I send them the prices ---&gt;they pick an option and then typically ask for same day delivery --&gt; I collect their address and number, call them then charge them a premium for same day delivery --&gt; I send them the payment portal to pay the double deposit (some customers prefer to do it when we are on site but I always try to do it before i dispatch my delivery guy) --&gt; I dispatch my delivery guy --&gt; delivery guy installs washer and dryer.--&gt; I send customer contract.\n\nSome more general tips:\n\n\\-MAKE SURE that the customer pays you MORE than what it costs for you to deliver and repo the unit if you are doing it through a third party like I did.\n\n\\-facebook market place is your BEST friend, please do not pay for ANY advertising.\n\n\\-get on the phone with the customer to build trust (nobody is going to send you $160 from just texting)\n\n\\-Call at LEAST 5 washer/dryer wholesellers to get the best prices on USED sets.\n\nI'm thinking about scaling another 10 or so washer and dryer sets over the next 3 months and implmenting ACTUAL kill switches (this will be the first time I ever see any of my washer and dryers).\n\nEdit: I believe this constitutes as passive income because after all of the set up(phone calls, messaging, document signing), it’s hands off) ",

So I would never suggest Etsy. It's also fickle, so I'd be in trouble if I depended on that alone. I have a 9-5 that is dependable. \n\nMy point is an actual job is going to make you income to support yourself while you find a side hustle to begin. Most side hustles are on the side because they don't give real pay the rent/mortgage type money. And all of them take a bit of time to develop.\n\nMy 'side hustles' that are fairly passive are things like Fetch Rewards and Evidation where you get points to exchange for gift cards. It isn't quick or steady money. \n\nThat's the biggest trouble with side hustles or working in ecommerce, you never know how much you will earn at any given time. It depends on trends, economy, how you present yourself/product, and how big of a social media following you can gain. \n\nI only mention all this because if you need the money to pay your bills, this isn't something to start now.",

Affiliate marketing is one, no inventory, low startup, but it does take learning and patience. Pinterest works especially well because content can drive traffic for months instead of days.\n\nDigital products are another good route if you have any knowledge or experience you can package into templates, guides, or simple resources. You create it once and sell it repeatedly.\n\nIf income is urgent, pairing something faster (freelance, VA work, local services) with a longer-term online strategy can take pressure off! \n\nWhatever you choose, I’d avoid anything promising “quick passive income.” The legit stuff usually takes effort upfront, but it does compound over time.\nAlways open to chat more!",

It’s pretty easy to outsource to other people over time, and it’s less physically demanding than other forms of care work.\n\nAnother example would be party rentals. I saw a post on Reddit today (not sure which sub fortunately) of someone who rents out a large, ‘throne’ style chair for photo shoots at birthdays and baby showers.\n\nIt’s bulky and expensive enough to deter people from buying their own, and the OP was able to undercut their local competitors (ie lower rental and free delivery within a certain area). \n\nAlternatively I would try to leverage a niche skill that has local demand. I have a family friend who rents out enormous cooking pots to members of his community to cater weddings and celebrations. Commercial rental companies don’t stock the style of pots needed by his community, and they can’t guarantee that their equipment has only been used to prepare specific types of food. He runs the business out of his garage and it’s about as close to passive as you can get (ie customers pick up and drop off, pay online).",

      "selftext": "I work a pretty boring corporate job in logistics. good salary but soul crushing. always wanted to do something creative on the side but honestly I have zero interest in being on camera. like none. my face is not going on the internet, period. so I spent a lot of time researching faceless content and kept seeing people talk about AI generated stuff.\n\nthe idea came from my girlfriend actually. she follows a ton of fashion accounts on instagram and pointed out that some of them looked kinda off. like the models were too perfect or the lighting was weird. turned out a bunch of them were using AI generated images. that got me thinking.\n\nso around january last year I decided to start a fitness motivation account. yeah I know, super saturated niche. but I figured the content would be easier to create since its mostly just aesthetic photos with motivational quotes. nothing groundbreaking.\n\nthe first three months were rough. I was using midjourney and some other tools to generate fitness model images but the problem was consistency. every image looked like a different person. followers would comment stuff like “who is this” or “thought this was a different girl” and it killed any sense of brand identity. I almost quit around month two because the engagement was terrible and I was spending like 2 hours a day just trying to get usable images.\n\nmonth four I started experimenting with different approaches. tried a bunch of tools like APOB, artbreeder, and some others I found on reddit. the game changer was figuring out how to maintain a consistent character across posts. once I locked in “her” look (athletic build, dark hair, mid 20s vibe) things started clicking. people actually started following because they thought they were following a real person’s fitness journey.\n\nthe content strategy was simple. post once a day, always the same “person” in different workout settings or athleisure outfits. gym shots, outdoor runs, yoga poses, that kind of thing. captions were either motivational quotes or fake personal stories about “my” fitness journey. felt a little weird at first writing in first person as this fictional character but honestly nobody questioned it.\n\nmonth six I hit 8k followers which qualified me for some micro influencer platforms. got my first brand deal for $75 to post about a protein powder. the brand sent product shots and I just had to incorporate their messaging. easy money for like 20 minutes of work.\n\nthe income breakdown right now at month 11:\n\nbrand deals: averaging about $280/month. I get maybe 4 to 5 offers per month, accept 2 or 3 that actually fit the account aesthetic. pay ranges from $50 to $120 per post depending on the brand.\n\naffiliate links: around $60/month from amazon associates. I link workout gear and supplements in my bio and stories. conversion rate is garbage honestly but it adds up.\n\nso total is roughly $340/month. not quitting my job money but considering I spend maybe 45 minutes a day on it now (batch creating content on sundays helps a lot), the hourly rate is decent.\n\nthe hard parts nobody talks about:\n\nfirst, the guilt. there are real fitness influencers grinding every day, actually working out, filming themselves, and here I am with a fake person getting brand deals. I’ve made peace with it because the brands know what they’re getting (I’m transparent that its an AI persona when they ask directly) but it still feels weird sometimes.\n\nsecond, the technical learning curve. getting consistent faces, good lighting, realistic poses took forever to figure out. my first hundred images were unusable. hands still look weird sometimes and I have to regenerate a lot.\n\nthird, engagement farming. you still have to actually engage with followers, respond to DMs, comment on other accounts. the content creation might be automated but the community building isn’t. I probably spend more time on engagement than actual content creation.\n\nthings I wish I knew earlier:\n\npick a niche where the AI aesthetic actually works. fitness, fashion, travel photography all work well because people expect polished, professional looking images. something like “day in my life” content would be way harder to fake convincingly.\n\ndon’t cheap out on the tools. I wasted two months using free generators that produced obvious AI garbage. the paid tools cost money but the quality difference is massive.\n\ntreat it like a real business from day one. I set up a separate email, separate instagram account obviously, and track everything in a spreadsheet. revenue, costs, time spent, engagement rates. helps you figure out what’s actually working.\n\nthe future plan is to expand to tiktok with short form video content. some of the newer tools can do image to video stuff that looks pretty convincing. already tested a few clips and the engagement seems promising. if I can crack video content, the brand deal rates go up significantly.\n\nalso thinking about starting a second account in a different niche. maybe home decor or cooking. the playbook is pretty repeatable once you figure it out.\n\nthe monthly time investment now is probably around 12 to 15 hours total. sundays I batch create 20 to 30 images for the week, schedule them out, then just check in daily for engagement. compared to the 40 plus hours I was putting in at the beginning, it finally feels somewhat passive.\n\nstill have a decent emergency fund saved up from my day job so worst case if the account gets banned tomorrow I’m not ruined. but so far instagram hasn’t flagged anything and the follower growth has been steady at about 800 to 1000 new followers per month.\n\nthe whole experience taught me that passive income is never truly passive at the start. the first six months were basically a part time job that paid nothing. but now that the systems are in place and the account has momentum, the effort to income ratio finally makes sense.",

My time investment now is about 3 hours monthly - 1 hour creating templates, 2 hours batching pins\n\nMonthly progression: april - june: $150-250 (manual posting), july: $480 (started tailwind),\n\naugust: $840, October: $1420\n\nTraffic: 2800+ monthly visitors from pinterest, conversion around 2.3% which is 65-70 sales monthly at $19-24 per template. Before automating I was burning out on marketing, now it's genuinely passive and sales happen whether I'm working or not\n\nFor anyone selling digital products I'd seriously recommend pinterest over instagram, the search intent is way better and tools like tailwind make it actually hands off",

      "selftext": "So this might sound weird, but hear me out.\n\nYou know how everyone's always looking for that perfect passive income stream? Well, I think Roblox development might actually be it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* 350M+ users, mostly kids with disposable Robux (their currency)\n* One-click purchases built into the platform\n* Games can generate revenue 24/7 once published\n* Low barrier to entry with AI coding tools now\n\nI started experimenting with [Rebirth](https://userebirth.com/), an AI tool that helps you code Roblox games. It automatically tests and debugs, so you don't need to be a programming wizard.\n\nThe crazy part? A simple game called \"Escape Tsunami For Brainrots!\" has 350K concurrent players. It looks super basic but kids LOVE it.\n\nOnce your game is up, it runs itself. Kids buy in-game items, game passes, and premium features with their allowance money (Robux). You cash out through Roblox's DevEx program. Blowing up as well is just ONE tiktok video.\n\nNot saying it's \"get rich quick\" but compared to other passive income ideas I've tried (dropshipping, print-on-demand, etc.), this actually has real earning potential with an audience that's EAGER to spend. \n\nHas anyone else tried this? What's been your experience? ",

The barrier of entry is so low, which means insane competition.\n\nBut on the other side of this, there’s now insane demand for monetization experts who know how to turn views into money without leaving a lot on the table.\n\nIn my opinion, learning to build funnels puts you in a golden spot in this influencer era. Finding clients is easy. I’ve had to raise my prices to the point where I won’t even consider anything under $10k/month base fee + commission.\n\nAnd you don’t have to work only with influencers. I built a funnel for a California construction company that sells Chinese backyard rental houses (unit price \\~$300k), and now they’re selling around 5 units per month. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything. Just wanted to throw this idea out here for those still starting out and standing at a road fork of choosing a business model.",

High-ticket stuff like your $300k units, B2B SaaS, or done-for-you agencies can all afford $10k/month + performance if you can prove ROAS in 60–90 days.\n\n\n\nIf someone wants to follow a similar path, I’d focus on: 1) one traffic source (YouTube ads, TikTok ads, or SEO), 2) one funnel type (lead gen → sales call or webinar → call), and 3) one niche where you can stack 3–5 case studies fast.\n\n\n\nTools-wise, I’ve bounced between GoHighLevel for the plumbing and ConvertKit/Klaviyo for email, plus Pulse for Reddit to mine real objections and language from niche subreddits so the funnel copy hits harder.\n\n\n\nMain point: specialize in turning attention into revenue and you’ll never struggle to find work.",

      "selftext": "I honestly feel like an idiot for quitting my facebook page three years ago. At the time, I thought the golden era was over, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The best time to start was then, but honestly, the second-best time is right now while everyone else is distracted by other platforms. I really think this is one of the best things to hop on in the next few years.\n\nI’m currently sitting on three pages, two in the animal niche and one on spirituality, and the momentum is starting to get crazy. Two of them already reached 11k and 13k followers just by hitting the first viral content. My roadmap for 2026 is to scale this up to 8-10 pages and hit $10k a month in 99% automated passive revenue.\n\nMost people don't realize that Facebook is the best platform for automated content because they don't actually care if you're posting via a third-party app or the official page. As long as the content is good and people are engaging, they wll push it. Thats the secret sauce that lets you automate the whole thing. Have not seen that on any other platform.\n\nI’m currently running a super simple ad strategy where I spend about $3 a day per page on simple page like ads. Goal is to get a new follower for under 1c. I’m consistently hitting between 1 and 2 cents per follower now, which is not too bad. When you mix that cheap, targeted growth with high quality automated content, things just start to explode.\n\nMy current workflow is about 90% automated. I wrote a python script that uses openai api for the captions and fal ai for the images, so the content literally creates itself. As soon as the script generates the post, it automatically schedules everything across all my pages through crosspostify api so I don’t even have to look at it. I just find Python more convenient for keeping the whole pipeline from idea to scheduled in one place, though you could definitely do something similar with n8n or Make if you aren't a coder. Just make sure to post 8-12 pieces of content per day and look what works. It is literally easy as that, look what works for competitor pages and try it and adjust. repeat until viral.\n\nThe only thing I’m still doing manually rn is the reels, but I’m working on automating the video production side next. Once thats dialed in, I’m launching two more niches I’ve already scouted.\n\nThe end goal is to get every single page into the content monetization program to farm the revenue. Once the traffic is there, I’ll start bridging those followers over to a dedicated website with display ads to really maximize the earnings. If you’re looking for a legit passive income play for 2026 please have a look on that thing. i genuinely think this is the single best passive income opportunity right now..",

Besides, translating 128 pages in two days, even as an experienced translator...no.\n\nIf they promised a high pay on top of a big project without any skill testing, plus very short timeline for such a long document...that's scam.\n\n Even with AI, that is too short for a proper translation. Plus as a beginner, untrained to recognise translation pitfalls or know how to solve even common issues that you come across in translation, you are simply not a proper candidate for that size project, even if that was a real project.\n\nJust don't.\n\n If you are serious about finding such work, educate yourself by contacting local translators' associations, doing research on proper pay and proper project parameters etc. Translation is currently a minefield of low pay to no pay, so make sure you are not working for free nor for a scammer representating as a big legitimate company.",

I also know the existing players in this market, but from what I can see, they’re not approaching Google Ads in a statistical, methodical, or science-based way.\n\n\nMy advantage is that I’ve worked in far more competitive markets before, and I can bring disciplined media buying, testing, and optimization skills into this space.\n\n\nThat brings me to my question: Is it still worth entering a market like this, even though the search volume is relatively low?\n\n\nOn one hand, there are larger markets where the same keywords might get 100,000+ searches per month, but competition is intense and most advertisers in that market know exactly what they’re doing when it comes to PPC campaigns.\n\n\nOn the other hand, this smaller market has lower search volume, but significantly less sophistication when it comes to Google Ads.\nI’m weighing the trade-offs:\n\n\nLarger market  has higher volume, higher competition, more advanced advertisers\n\nSmaller market has lower volume, weaker competition, more room to outperform. \n\n\nIs this type of market still viable long-term?

Can someone explain if I’m just missing something.\n\nI’m in real estate depreciation is much different because it’s a passive loss and gets added back to income which makes you more bankable. So I can see why cost segs under 100% bonus depreciation is hyped but not “write off’s” in other businesses\n\nEdit: People are not realizing I am talking about the people who say “you can just write it off” about everything. I’m talking about the items that aren’t necessarily needed, or a new one is not needed but someone is wanting to decrease their tax bill. The math doesn’t make any sense.

Maybe some horse feeding on the shop repairs entry. \n\nVery common. That is an ability to access leverage a W2 would not have. I'm not condoning, or advising, but I would assume that ability (if the business is making money) would be if higher advantage than the \"write-off\" as legally taken.",

Anyway, back in September this lady emails me asking if I could take her dead plants and turn them into some kind of preserved art piece for her wall. Like pressed flowers but for her crispy monstera that she killed. I honestly thought she was messing with me.\n\nBut she was dead serious (no pun intended) and offered to pay me $80 for it. I was like whatever, why not, had some saved money from Stаke set aside for random experiments anyway. Took me maybe 3 hours total including the framing. Posted a pic of the final thing on instagram just cause it looked pretty cool, got way more engagement than my usual posts.\n\nNext thing I know I'm getting like 15 DMs a week from people wanting the same thing. Turns out theres this whole guilt thing with plants where people feel bad throwing them away and want to \"honor\" them or whatever. Some interior designers started reaching out too because apparently dead plant art is having a moment??\n\nNow Im doing 20 to 30 of these a month at $95 each and honestly the margins are insane compared to selling live plants. No shipping stress, no dealing with weather delays killing inventory, and people are way less picky than with living plants. The community around it is also super engaged which helps with word of mouth.\n\nI still sell regular plants but this accidental thing is now my main income source and I barely advertised it. Just goes to show sometimes the dumbest sounding ideas are worth testing out.",

September to now is four months and you're claiming you went from one random request to 20-30 monthly clients purely from Instagram engagement with zero advertising.

Live plants have spoilage, shipping risk, seasonal demand, and customers get upset when things die. Dead plant art has none of that. You're basically selling preserved inventory with unlimited shelf life.\n\nAlso \"dead plant art is having a moment\" is the most 2024 sentence I've read in a while. But honestly it makes sense - people spend money on house plants because they want the aesthetic, not because they love caring for living things. You're selling the aesthetic without the maintenance burden.\n\nCurious how you handle the sourcing - are these all customer plants or do you ever buy \"dead stock\" from nurseries? Feel like there might be an angle there if nurseries are throwing away inventory anyway.",

It can always work better faster, harder later.\n\nI stocked up a war chest for almost nine years.In my business. I just mastered the mundane and kept doing what was working.And didn't get fancy.\n\nWhen the new trump trade war started, I was able to drop a massive amount of capital on massive amount of inventory and avoid our tariffs jumping from the 25% we had been paying since 2018, to 100-150%.\n\nThis allowed us to keep our pricing the same. Last year, one of the other two manufacturers that supply our niche of commercial truck parts globally was absorbed by the other. Both were already 50% more expensive than we are, even though we have twice the profit margins. Once they completed the buyout, the company raised its prices another thirty to forty five percent!\n\nWe gained 127 new customers the first month after the buyout. For the last three months, we have seen double digit new customers coming on board. \n\nThe company that bought our other competitor is bleeding customers for this niche every day.\n\nWe recouped every dollar that we spent though.We did burn through what was supposed to be 24 months of inventory in just over 12. We have the cash flow, though, and we've already got 2 more inventory orders on the water that should arrive any day. Today I had five new customers.Come on board that were bleeding off of the competitor. \n\nWe did our first price increase in ten years on january first for 7%. We still dominate our market in pricing. And quality, and we still have almost 80% net profit margins with the new inventory lines coming in.\n\nI'd like biographies. Founder's Podcast is excellent.

The tension between scaling and safety is real though.\n\n\n\nOne thing that helped businesses I know navigate this: automating the processes BEFORE scaling. If you automate your core workflows now, you can actually scale revenue without proportionally scaling headcount or risk.\n\n\n\nThink about it - if you can automate 30-50% of your operational overhead, you can take on 50% more volume without hiring, which means less fixed costs and lower risk while still growing.\n\n\n\nBefore you and your cofounder compromise on strategy, map out which parts of your operation could be automated. That usually gives you a third option: scale with existing team + automation. Gives you growth without the risk exposure you're worried about.\n\n\n\nJust a thought, but it's honestly how a lot of profitable businesses approach scaling without burning cash.",

I couldn't tell who was good until months of cash had already burned.\n\nhere is what i wish i knew earlier:\n\n**Too much jargon is a red flag.**\n\nGood developers explain their work simply. \"I added the password reset button. Now users get an email when they click it.\" While bad developers hide behind complexity. \"I refactored the auth middleware to handle session state.\"\n\nIf your dev leaves you more confused at the end of the conversation, that's not because you're dumb. It's because they're either hiding something or they don't truly understand what they built\n\n**Commit frequency matters even if you can't read code.**\n\nGo to your repo on GitHub. You don't need to understand the code. Just look at the patterns.\n\nIf you see multiple commits per week with clear messages like \"feat: added user profile page\" then that's good, while one giant commit every 10 days labeled \"updates\" or \"fixes\" is bad .\n\nKeep this as a rule of thumb: Small frequent commits = good habits. One giant weekly commit = poor planning or last-minute cramming.\n\n**\"Almost done\" is almost always a lie.**\n\nIf your dev always answers to your queries about what happened with : \"almost done\". they're either stuck and won't admit it, or they're actually not working.\n\nGood devs give specifics: \"password reset is done. email templates will be done in Thursday. Then I'll use two days to test.\"\n\n**The best developers push back on your ideas.**\n\nThis always keep surprising me. The devs who keep saying yes to every request are actually the worst. They weren't thinking, just billing\n\nThe best developer I ever hired regularly told me my ideas were wrong. \"That feature would take 6 weeks. What if we did this simpler version instead?\"\n\nThat's what you want. You don't want a mindless machine, but someone that will help you and correct you if you're wrong.\n\n**Weekly demos reveal everything.**\n\nStop accepting status updates. Ask your dev every Friday for a working demo of what he is working on. Even if it is still unfinished.\n\nGood developers love showing their work, but the bad ones always have an excuse for why they can't demo yet.\n\nBy the time your gut tells you something is wrong. You've already lost months.  \nWhat i found the most helpful is getting visibility earlier not until it's obvious\n\nWhat signals do you look for when evaluating developers? Curious what's worked for others here.",

Buggy apps always work if the user follows a very fixed correct path, but users are not perfectly rational and apps are buggy because developers don't think about these things.

I asked him what he’d actually do if he had to start again today. No audience, no brand, no clients. What surprised me wasn’t anything flashy, but how slow and manual the first phase really was.\n\n1) He focused on one free channel He tried a lot over time, but early on it was mostly consistent posting aimed at a very specific buyer. Nothing viral. Just showing up.\n\n2) He kept his online presence extremely simple One page that made it clear who it was for and what problem it solved. No fancy site.\n\n3) Early outreach was very manual He spent a lot of time personally replying to people who engaged but didn’t reach out. No automation.\n\n4) He didn’t judge results quickly He mentioned that most of the benefits only showed up after sticking with it longer than felt comfortable.\n\nI’m curious if others here have seen similar patterns, or if this breaks down at some point.",

Scale and automation only helps once you have a manual workflow that is nailed down really well.\n\nIf you are getting started, assuming you have a product that actually solved a problem, first identify your ideal customer persona! Who are the exact set of users who badly need your solution right now!\n\nOnce you have the ideal customer persona, list down all the marketing channels you can use to find them- wherever they hang out- be it reddit, manual out reach on linkedin or even meta/google ads! once you have this list, your goal is to run time boxed and budget constrained rapid experiments in parallel to find out out which marketing channel works best for you at this stage. Ideally you will find one that outperforms rest! Once you have this channel you can essentially scale up till it breaks. Once it breaks, you kinda have to repeat the process all over again. But that doesn't usually happen until you cross $1M in revenue etc!\n\nHope this helps :)",

The manual phase sucks but it's where you figure out what actually resonates.  \n  \nOne thing I'd add is the type of content matters a lot in that first phase. I spent way too long posting general advice that got decent engagement but zero clients. What shifted things was posting actual examples from deals we were working on. Redacted screenshots, specific objections we handled, what changed our close rate that week.  \n  \nIt was less polished but people could tell it was real. The replies became actual conversations instead of \"great post\" comments.  \n  \nThe other thing about keeping outreach manual early on is you learn so much faster. I could see which hooks got responses, which industries ghosted us, what follow-up timing worked.

I needed high enrollment to pay myself so I had to figure out a way to get more parents in the door. I tried a bunch of different things but what I landed on that had the biggest impact was making my business the happiest workplace it could possibly be for my employees. I learned to be kind but firm, both with parents who were being unrealistic or difficult and also with my employees. They learned that I wouldn't allow them to be mistreated. I created amazing benefits, including higher pay, bonuses for hitting benchmarks, and more time off. I insisted on a positive culture and got teachers behind it so that it started to grow organically. By creating a workplace that my staff had never experienced before, they worked harder. They understood that to get the kind of benefits and environment that I had created meant that they also had to follow my rules such as always smile at parents when they dropped off or picked up, going the extra mile for a child or a parent, extra training, do the right thing, be nice to your coworkers, come on time, etc. Once I had all that in place, the parents naturally noticed the difference. My team was friendly and happier than anything they saw in the preschool industry. They noticed that their children loved coming to school and were truly cared for. They told their friends about it. People started driving long distances just to enroll with us. I was able to open a second school and fill that up fairly quickly because of my practices. In the child care industry, just getting 85% enrollment is really good. Before I sold my business, I consistently was at 95%+. People didn't want to unenroll during the summer months because they didn't want to lose their place. I had staff who was with me for 5, 10, 15 years. I am very proud of what I accomplished. By treating my team like gold and holding them to a higher standard, the sales took care of themselves.",

(onboarding issue)\n\nI learned this the hard way: our \"overall 80% retention\" looked healthy, but cohort analysis showed April signups retained at 65% while June was at 88%. Turned out we'd fixed a critical onboarding bug in May, but the blended average completely masked the improvement.\n\nYour bounce rate example is the same principle ... aggregates lie, segmentation reveals truth. The metric isn't overlooked because people don't know it exists, it's overlooked because most dashboards show the easy number instead of the uncomfortable breakdown.",

      "selftext": "When I started my company, I was naive.\n\nI thought success and money would come fast.  \nSix months. Maybe a year.\n\nI believed that if the idea was good and I worked hard enough, things would line up.  \nThat investors were out there, waiting for founders like me to show up with the right story.\n\nThat belief didn’t come from nowhere.  \nSocial media makes entrepreneurship look fast, obvious, and rewarding, especially if you are willing to sacrifice a bit.\n\nReality was very different.\n\nEarly on, I met an entrepreneur who had been through a divorce.  \nI asked him about his journey and about the divorce.\n\nHe told me something simple:\n\n“Everything has a price.  \nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nAt the time, I understood the words.  \nI didn’t understand the depth.\n\nWhat I know now is that entrepreneurship doesn’t just test your skills.  \nIt tests how much uncertainty you can live with, and for how long, without breaking.\n\nIt’s lonely.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nIn a quiet, repetitive way.\n\nThere are very few celebrations.  \nJust an endless stream of decisions, doubts, and problems to solve.  \nEvery day.\n\nYou lose people along the way.\n\nNot because you become arrogant.  \nNot because you “don’t care anymore.”  \nBut because you stop building an acceptable life, one where responsibility is shared, and move toward a life where outcomes fall largely on you.\n\nYou stop drifting.  \nYou take control.  \nAnd once you do, there’s no one left to blame.\n\nThat mindset doesn’t stay at work.\n\nIt changes how you see relationships.  \nTime.  \nCompromise.  \nRisk.\n\nYou start operating with a level of intensity and accountability that not everyone around you wants or can follow.\n\nIn my case, this contributed to my divorce.  \nI couldn’t stay in a relationship that no longer worked for either of us.  \nThat choice came with real loneliness.\n\nI also used to believe entrepreneurship was about eventually sharing success with your family.  \nMore freedom.  \nMore time.  \nMore presence.\n\nWhat I didn’t anticipate is that the transition itself is costly.\n\nYou lose time before you gain any.  \nYou are less present than you’d like.  \nAnd the emotional margin shrinks long before the rewards show up.\n\nThere is something important I wish I had understood earlier.\n\nEntrepreneurship is not just hard.  \nIt is hard in a very specific way.\n\nIf you struggle with prolonged uncertainty,  \nif you need frequent reassurance,  \nif financial stress or ambiguity quickly destabilize you,  \nthis path can slowly erode you.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because not everyone is wired to operate for long periods without feedback, validation, or safety nets.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nThere is no shame in choosing stability.  \nIn preferring predictable income.  \nIn building a life with more emotional space.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn’t better.  \nIt isn’t braver.  \nIt is simply a different set of trade offs, and a very expensive one psychologically.\n\nI am not sharing this to complain or to glorify suffering.  \nI chose this path, and I still do.\n\nBut if you are considering it, be honest with yourself about the price.  \nAnd if you are already on it and feeling this weight,\n\nyou are not broken.\n\nYou are experiencing what this path actually demands.",

When I was in my early thirties, I almost gave up and chose stability. Find a large growing family and my wife wasn't on the same page with my long-term goals, and who I was as a person. After fifteen years it led to our divorce.\n\nAt absolute rock bottom in December 2016 I went out one New Years eve, broken, and ready for the end. I met my now wife that night just before midnight. We spent three and a half days talking. She told me to kick off bottom.She saw who I was deep down.\n\nIt made all the difference in the world. I thought maybe...\n\n2017 I started my business with literally nothing but my skills, knowledge, and enough spark to kick hard off bottom. I'd built companies over and over again that were very successful for the people that i've worked for over the years. I knew what to do, and I had a new energy to do it. I had nothing to lose and I had everything to lose.\n\nLooking back, I did believe within that first year we would break seven figures easily. We had a commercial truck part that had never been manufactured overseas. We chose higher grade materials, and we modified the designs to make installation a fraction of the time. I set the price at 50%-60% less than anyone else in the market. I made a 150-200 cold calls everyday except some Sundays for many many years consistently.\n\nLike you I slowly realized that it was definitely going to be a much longer journey. Those first four years we ate at food banks more than we ate at grocery stores. Well, at least my wife and I did. We let the kids eat the good stuff and they never knew.\n\nThe divorce dragged on for 6 long years. I changed my goal to wanting. Fuck you money so I could get better lawyers, specialists, and private detectives. I lost 2 daughters in that season and a son whom I was eventually able to find and reconnect with. I gained three amazing stepchildren. Lost a few people to covid. Almost lost the home five different times. Eventually, choosing to sell it, and buying an r v to live in. Cut all holidays and birthdays down to homemade gifts. Downsize everything out of our lives. Ran up hundreds of thousands in lawyer debts. \n\nThe struggles were what motivated me to work through it though. I couldn't sleep. I knew my kids were out there somewhere alive. A human is not built to successfully grieve a child that is missing but still alive.\n\nAfter my wife and kids were in bed, I would get out of bed and work until 2-4am at times. Not because I wanted to, but I couldn't sleep. Those days and weeks and months may have been what pushed us through those first four years. \n\nI wouldn't change any of it. We achieved the freedom of time, more control of our lives, touched countless lives with the resources we have built at the fuck you money stage. \n\nIt's not for everyone now.And that's okay. My biggest lesson that i've learned is you have to find bliss in the day to day.No matter what.",

With ads. Forget the overhead and LLC and all the irrelevant parts. Go straight to sales. Once you have proven that there are customers on the other side, ready, willing and able to pay for the product. Then, and only then, build a business.

          "body": "Thanks for sharing. You bring out a number of points that I certainly experienced as a two time entrepreneur. Maybe one of the most insightful and honest words about what it takes to be a real entrepreneur. What really hits home is:\n\n“Everything has a price.\nIf you are not willing to pay it, you don’t get the reward.”\n\nI started my first company as a spin off of another company that was sold. I had a partner who was the university-based founder of the first company. Plus, other key people from that company were investors in the spin off. I was CEO for 2 years and stepped back into a CTO role and my partner left the university to come on board as CEO. We raised over $70M, got in the pipeline to do an IPO, then 911 hit and the shit really hit fan. We ended up laying off 80% of our staff (many who were good friends).  We refocused on our core and took a few years to stabilize. We got new investors, my cofounder was pushed out, new management came in and the company was sold for 2-3 years later for $50M. I worked my ass off for 10+ years and only got about $300K out of the sale. I left shortly after, looked for job, couldn’t find one and decided to start a new company again.\n\nI moved with my wife and 12 year old son to a state where I didn’t know anyone. A fresh start. I licensed technology out of the local university and started a new company on my own. I did everything myself for a year and got some part time contractors to help (including key tech workers from the university). I got some early sales and had investors knocking on my door. I was trying to avoid taking any investor money, but I was burning thru my personal savings, so I decided to take on some investment. My goal was to raise as little as possible while getting sales. Ultimately ended of raising about $15M over an 8 years period and sold the company for nearly $100M. As the sole founder I did pretty well. \n\nAlong the way, I experienced many of the personal issues you mentioned. My wife left me because I just didn’t have time for her or my son. This still pains me nearly 20 years later. Eventually we reconciled and are doing well today, but the journey was extremely painful on a personal basis, but hugely rewarding from a business perspective.   I’ve been a board member, advisor, investor in a number of other startups and try to warn the founders of the personal pains they will experience, the commitment required, etc. Most just don’t make it, especially if they have something else they can fall back onto. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

This is a pretty common positive side for almost everyone. But no has really talked about the negative and dark side of the journey. Let me start with mine. I started working at different startups to learn more about the industry and ecosystem. After a good years of experience, I started working on my own startup. It’s been two years, I’ve gone through depression, anxiety, not having enough runway, running out of money, almost becoming homeless, suicidal thoughts, no personal life, investor rejections, tons of refining my idea, solution based on problem space. Even at the initial stage, my customers insulted me and told me to shut down the project because it was a waste of time, money and resources. Later, I did self validations, improved myself, my idea, solution and learned more about my customers.\n\nPlease share your dark experience of being as a founder.",

Everyone tells you to work hard and that you have to grind because your competitors are grinding harder than you, but nobody ever talks about the importance of balance and not feeling guilty for not working hard all the time. I hope if any new founders are reading this, that you make it a focus to take care of yourself first and foremost, and never lose sight of what makes you happy, or your hobbies. The grind is not worth it, at least in my eyes. There are better ways to achieve your goals through a slow, methodical, and well thought out plan of attack.

However, even after months of actively thinking about it, I still struggle to identify a problem that makes me confident enough to say: “this is the one worth investing my time and energy in.”\n\nHow do you personally go from “I want to build something” to identifying a real problem worth solving?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

I don’t look for ideas, I collect annoyances. Stuff that feels slightly broken, inefficient, overpriced, confusing, or just dumb. Especially things people complain about but then accept as normal. Those are gold.\n\nProduct Hunt is useful, but not for copying ideas. I look at reviews and comments instead. What are people mad about. What are they paying for but still unhappy with. What features are missing. That’s usually where the real opportunity is, not the product itself.\n\nAnother big shift for me was realising that most businesses are not brand new problems. They’re better, narrower, cheaper, simpler versions of existing solutions. Uber didn’t invent taxis. Notion didn’t invent notes. They just made something people preferred using",

Wouldn't people pay a premium for that? Or, extra virgin olive oil pressed by the monks living in a remote monastery in Southern Europe with a production capacity of a few hundred litres a year.

If I'm paying the same price as the big supermarkets and customer service is nothing special and the product is commoditised, I'd choose to spend my money with a company that invests in social good. Spend 1% of your revenue planting trees or installing solar panels or donate the money to funds fighting against big corporations exploiting animals/people/the planet.\n\n4. Underdog. As above. Some people choose to support underdogs. Tell your story. Why are you building this business? If the service/product is good, I will always support the underdog. For some of my purchases, I don't spend money with the bigger guys. Don't want to make the 1% richer.\n\n5. Package things. Anyone can buy a hammer, nails, a screwdriver, screws, etc... cheaply.

Equity in the whole company vs just a route/book of clients.  \n\\- How profits are calculated (gross vs net, what expenses come off the top, owner salary).  \n\\- Decision rights (pricing, hiring, equipment purchases).  \n\\- What happens if one of you wants out (buyout formula, non-compete, client ownership).  \n  \nAlso: measure your real contribution. If you’re the one doing the work + retaining customers, you have leverage.  \n  \nTactical tip: build your own “operations dashboard” so you’re not negotiating blind. I’ve seen people use Manus (AI no-code web builder) to set up a simple full-stack internal tool: a database of clients, job history, and margins, with authentication so only you/your boss can access it. You can even add Stripe integration for deposits or recurring plans if you ever spin off. Having clean numbers (not just “I hustle hard”) changes partnership talks.  \n  \nNot legal advice, but if the offer is real, a fair contract + transparent bookkeeping protects both sides and keeps the hustle from turning into resentment.",

Longtime Members of an industry usually know what’s going on, it’s part of the job. If you don’t have such knowledge, learn. Read up and ask questions about everything related to the job. \n\n2. You can certainly buy a small and stable business, but that’s expensive, and you are already locked in to what it is. Both have their places.\n\n3. It’s not a deal breaker, but having industry experience already lets you get started faster and less learning curve. \n\n4. Going too big too fast, having big dreams and ideas. You don’t need 10 tools or AI this or optimization workflow that. I have 3: CRM, Inventory, Accounting. It’s boring for a reason, business comes in and business goes out, no fancy projects. \n\n5.

Just pick any business that already exists, and do it slightly better,  show up on time,  offer good service,  be consistent.   That's really all it takes to run a good business.   You don't need to re-invent the wheel.  Think garbage removal,  window cleaning, roofing company, landscaping, moving company etc.\n\nDon't buy an existing business or take on a huge loan.  You find something that you can start out small at.  Ideally something you don't need to to to school for like learning a trade (pumber, electrician).  Let's say garbage removal.   You start by working a traditional job,  getting your expenses really lean and saving up enough money to buy a big, cheap pickup truck.   You register a business, make a website, learn everything you can online from YouTube,  reddit,  books from the library about garbage removal and starting a small business.   You start social media accounts, hire a friend or someone on fiver to make you a logo.   You post ads on kijiji, craigslist, Facebook marketplace.   You get your first few jobs and get paid cash.   They leave you a good review.   You find a local business center that offers grants to small businesses and offers free classes and resources for local entrepreneurs.  You get a few more jobs.  You learn about how collecting and paying sales tax works and you get setup with quickbooks.  You design and print up door knockers and leave them on 1000 doors.  You try more sales and marketing things.   You get more work.   Eventually,  you have enough jobs that you can finance a big truck with a bin that you leave in their driveway.  You get bigger invoices.  Eventually you quit your full time job.   You keep working hard and growing.   You get so busy that you need to hire your first employee.  You get a 2nd truck etc etc etc.\n\nI studied business in school but it really doesn't translate to actually starting your own business.   You mostly learn by doing the thing. \n\nI am a self employed real estate photographer and i also run an online community for photographers to learn and grow.   All in,  i earn low 6 figures.  If i wanted to put the effort in,  i could do more sales, hire employees,  and build a small real estate media agency. \n\nYou just gotta start and take it one step at a time.",

We’ll both be turning 18 this year, and due to cultural pressure, she will most likely be getting forced into marriage after she turns 18.\n\nBut we want to break the chain. So even if our family tries to force us do something against our will, we can simply live separately by handling our own expenses.\n\nFor this reason I have entered entrepreneurship a little over a year ago, trying to build financial independence and I haven't been quite successful with it yet.\n\nMy gf can’t contribute directly because of cultural restrictions. After household chores, she barely even gets time to study. Business or entrepreneurship is completely off limits for her given her family restrictions.\n\nDespite all this, I’ve noticed something important about her. She manages to take sunset and nature pictures as like she got this attraction with clicking pictures. She’s also a space enthusiast, so she often stays up late to capture events.\n\nUnfortunately, she doesn’t have a camera, so the quality of the pictures isn’t great.\nThe main reason for me telling all this is because she told me she wants to contribute to our goals. But since she can’t directly work on business or entrepreneurship, she wants to do it through things she’s already allowed to do. \n\nSo she asked me if we could utilize her photography to earn money and scale. And honestly, I have no idea if that’s even possible, so I’m asking here for guidance.\n\nI’ve also noticed she’s a big enthusiast of storytelling. She’s currently writing a novel (at least that’s what she told me), and it’s genuinely good. I’ve read a few pages she managed to write (she can’t spend much time on it), and the story impressed me. I think she could potentially use this skill too.\n\nOverall, I want to know whether her skills (photography or writing) can realistically be used to earn money, even at a small scale given our constraints.

If you have the premium account, they pay you some money if you have engagement and a lot of views. It should be possible to do that with photos, the more photos she takes the better.

I want to be optimistic because I’ve bet my career on this, but we need to be honest about what’s actually happening on the ground.\nIf you believe the headlines, we are a superpower now. Electronics production hit $135B (₹11.3 lakh crore) last year, and we are the 2nd largest mobile manufacturer in the world. On paper, it looks like a revolution.\nBut in my studio, the reality feels different.\nThe issue is that while the \"Production\" numbers are up 6x, the local value add is stuck at like 15-20%. That means for every \"Made in India\" phone, ~85% of the value is still just imported parts that we screw together here.\nI dug into the trade data to see if I was just imagining it, and it’s actually getting worse in some areas:\nOur imports from China almost doubled between 2017 and 2024 (hit ~$129B).\nWe still rely on them for 94% of our Li-ion batteries and 88% of ICs.\nThe bottleneck isn't talent.\nThe issue I face daily is speed vs. compliance. If I’m in Shenzhen, I can get a complex PCB prototyped and assembled in 3 days. Here, I spend that same time just waiting for a specific sensor to clear customs or dealing with BIS certification paperwork.\nI’m trying to solve this for my clients by handling the end-to-end mess for them, but it’s an uphill battle.\nI’m curious to hear from other hardware founders here: What is the actual blocker for you?\nIs it that you literally can't source the components locally, or is it that the BIS/Customs headache just makes it not worth the effort compared to importing white-label stuff?",

I have several people I trade lead referrals with for various reasons that do the exact same thing I do and their existance makes my life easier.\n\nTLDR: If they value themselves appropriately and dont drag down the market I wouldnt care. If they undercut do not play that game it means they are failing in some area and desperate to get work, you will win in the long run or they will drop to a lower tier of clientele to continue existing and not be your problem anymore either way. You have an existing base and quality standards, sell the quality of your service and your years of experience, you don't need to be the cheapest.",

      "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years. Back in March I landed a restaurant owner who needed a simple website menu, hours, contact form, maybe 10 pages total. $2,500, signed contract, everything by the book. First month goes great. He's responsive, sends assets on time, compliments the work. I'm thinking this is the dream client. Then the site launches and the \"quick questions\" start. \"Can you just add a reservations button?\" Sure, 30 minutes, I'll throw it in. \"Can you make the menu downloadable as a PDF?\" Fine, easy. \"Can you add a little animation to the header?\" Okay, getting annoying but whatever. By month two I've done maybe 15 of these \"quick\" things. I finally sit down and add it up 12 hours of extra work. At my rate that's $600 I just gave away for free. So I send him a nice email explaining that future changes will be billed hourly, gave him my rate, even offered a discount because we had a good relationship. He loses it. Says I'm \"nickel and diming\" him. Says a \"real professional\" would stand behind their work. Says he thought we were \"building something together.\" I tried to explain the original scope was delivered months ago but he just kept saying \"it's the same website though.\"\n\nYesterday he left me a 1-star Google review saying I \"surprised him with hidden fees after the project was done.\" The thing that kills me is I don't even think he's being malicious. He genuinely doesn't understand that what he asked for was extra. In his head, he hired me to \"do his website\" and the website isn't done until he says it's done. I should have had this conversation after the second or third request. Instead I stayed quiet trying to be the \"chill\" freelancer and now I'm the bad guy. How do you even explain scope to a client who doesn't think in those terms? Or do you just avoid these clients entirely?",

          "body": "My solution to this problem with clients works every time.\n\nStep 1: have client send links to sites similar to what they want their site to look like and similar to the contents they envision. Tell them to group the links by (a) sites with color schemes they like, (b) with layouts they like, and (c) content and content organization they like.\n\nStep 2: set up a 15 minute zoom call to go through the sites they provide so you have an idea for layout, color and mending. Keep it to 15 minutes, you are training the client to be concise.\n\nStep 3: create 3 mock-ups. I call them mentally bare-bones, expected choice, and kitchen sink. But I describe them to the client as entry level business profile, typical feature informational website, and custom professional website. Price differential should be very wide, like $800, $2,200 and $25,000.\n\nStep 3: give them a process timeline and a build analogy. I use a home building metaphor which goes \"We first draw the blueprint, and you can make any change at that point such as different layout, menus, number of pages or sections, features, etc. Then we lay the foundation which is where we register the URL, build the menus (plumbing), lay out each page (rooms). Then we complete the look and feel with text and images (finish carpentry and flooring.)\" You do this to be able to say \"remember, i told you there is no charge to change the site layout during 'blueprint' phase, but we are now at the finish stage and the change you are asking for takes us back two stages, so it will be expensive to do this as we have to tear up the pipes and cement. I will give you a price quote for that change.\"\n\nThis works for me. When they jump to \"hey, we really need to add a blah-blah-widget\" you can say \"Great! That was one of the features I suggested in my proposal for a professional level site! Should I go ahead and give you a quote for that addition?\"",

You should have already, after 4 years, addresses the cut off time for included updates, and the cost for additional updates and the cost. Be clear about maintenance going forward. Ask if they want a pre-paid retainer or to do it by the item.\n2. You basically punished them for making updates and failed to provide CLEAR information about future updates. It can feel like getting nickel and dimed.\n3. You offered to do the work free - you started the problem.\n4. In consultations, I say something like: \"The website is done. You pay the final invoice. A month goes by and you want to update the site. Depending on what you need, the maintenance cost is this, this, or this. You can do it hourly, or purchase a discounted update pack for a group of changes, or a retainer for regular updates.\"\n5. If a client doesn't understand what's extra, that's a failing on your part. It needs to be in writing and it needs to be initialed and it needs to be communicated several times, and you need to get an answer on how they plant to manage the site going forward.\n6. You can offer a monthly update for XYZ dollars and it might include (5) updates and you list those updates. Major functionality like a reservation system with a mobile app, or getting DoorDash functionality, etc. All the updates requested above, I'd do in a monthly maintenance session for $55 - about 20 minutes of work usually. Adding a menu PDF is problematic, the menu changes, add a solution where they can make updates to the menu and a \"Print PDF\" is automatic.\n7. There are tasks as Webmaster that are included in their annual hosting/domain renewal - things like new email addresses, backups, restore, etc.\n8. I took a lot of lumps when I started my brand and web development company. Each issue with a client taught me how to be smarter with the next.\n9. I made a lot of areas self-manageable and offered to train them or an employee. I also included a user guide with easy steps to update a page or add a page.\n10. All these things they are asking for should have been offered anyway. Go ahead and add these items to your offerings for restaurants.\n11. I also make them complete an online form in their account, for requesting updates. They check boxes for what they want done, and it indicates \"included in current maintenance plan\" or \"additional fees\". If they go over a certain amount, it adds fees. One client dumped me because he wanted to text me at all hours and I told him I don't do business by text. Log in to his account and submit requests - there needs to be a record. He came back after a while.\n12. It sounds cliche, but an educated customer is your best customer - you have to educate them.\n\n**Good luck next time. As for the 1 star, if you're able to respond:**\n\n&gt;\" Nicks Cafe is a valued client and we are proud of the work we were able to do in launching their new web site. The contracted and paid web design phase was for 6 weeks. Once the site launched, any updates are billed either hourly or through a maintenance plan. Any errors or loss of functionality, we correct at no charge, but new pages, new features, or changes or deletions, are billed items. We apologize that the maintenance costs were not understood. We welcome the opportunity to make it right by offering a discounted 1 year maintenance plan. We have reached out to Nick with this offer.\"\n\nFigure out what deep discount you can offer to save your reputation and reach out to the client. For me, it's worth it to even give him a set amount of updates per month for a year at $100. The business you lose is infinite. Be sure to come up with a pricing plan for 2027 that keeps him happy after you see what he requested in updates this year. I also use clients like this to try out new features I install free. Then when it's tested, I can actively market it and point to them as a LIVE example.\n\nA lot of people are telling you to snark, but it's partly your fault for not being clear. If you value customers who put food on the table, be kind, but be firm and professional. My business was 99% word of mouth. Not one client in my portfolio would say a bad word about me. Do whatever it takes to make it right - within reason - and fine tune your contracts and communication about price.\n\nIn freelancing, when there's a problem, take a look a how you failed. If it's not in writing, it's you. DM me and I can share some CRM solutions that help you manage clients and costs and requests.",

In his mind, it feels like being taken hostage -- he can keep paying more and more at a rate he didn't necessarily agree to pay, to reach a complete website; or he can accept a subpar website. Neither solution is really palatable to him, so maybe he felt no other escape but an angry review.\n\nSolution: In the next contract, either break down 'website' further into individual items (button == X, subpage == Y, copy edit == Z, ...) or just spell out the hourly rate for add-ons.\n\nFrom your standpoint, what you can do to recover those lost/unbilled hours is to charge a higher hourly rate on this next contract. So over time, you break even again and even go higher. But don't damage the client relationship by nickel-and-diming. You have a right to your time, but acknowledge his feelings, turn him positive by saying you'll do it for free **for this website** \\-- and then just spell out hourly rates or a menu of items in the next contract. You'll make a fan out of him and come out ahead, plus he won't leave that review.\n\nAt this stage, maybe you can ask for him to remove the 1-star review in that next contract.\n\nThis is how I've done it. I've been on both sides. His feelings are sound. So are yours. Just take the loss on this one contract, then apply your adjusted expectations to the next one -- or walk away. Think long-term. You want happy clients. Guys who are noisy 1-star reviews are also noisy in 5-star praise. So turn him into the 5-star guy by swallowing your ego, acknowledging his feelings, and then playing for the next contract, with much more specific breakdowns and a favorable hourly rate.

However, if you don't have a scope, or it's lacking in detail, that's on you and you need to improve your communication. If you spell out what's in your scope but don't spell out that anything beyond the scope if \"X per hour, 30 minute minimum\", you need to fix that, too. \n\nMost problems humans have with each other is just lack of clear communication and understanding and doing that effectively is VERY difficult and no matter what you do, there'll be things that are missed (or ignored).\n\nWelcome to business!",

So every new idea still feels like “the same website” to them.\n\nWhere things usually go wrong (and you already spotted this) is silence. Each “quick favor” silently resets their expectation of what’s included. By the time you bring up billing, it feels sudden to them — even if it’s completely reasonable.\n\nWhat’s worked better for me over time:\n\n* Define the scope in **plain outcomes**, not technical tasks launch-ready site with X pages; post-launch changes billed.\n* Introduce the concept of paid changes **early**, even if you waive the first 1–2 small ones. That sets the mental model.\n* Frame it as a **process**, not a fee: “After launch, all changes go through a small change request so nothing breaks.”\n\nAs for avoiding these clients — you usually can’t. Restaurants, small businesses, first-time website owners often think this way. The real filter isn’t the client; it’s whether you enforce boundaries *before* resentment builds.\n\nThe Google review hurts, but honestly, most experienced freelancers reading your story will recognize it immediately because we’ve all learned this lesson the same way.",

You could work it kind of like a retainer or you could just even reframe it and give him a discount as in this would’ve been $600 worth of work, but I’ll charge you $399 a month which will cover this many changes/hours.

      "selftext": "I've been doing web development for about 4 years now. Last year I landed this marketing agency that became my anchor client steady projects, $1,000-1,200 a month, super professional, paid within 48 hours every time. I'm thinking this is what sustainable freelancing looks like. Around November they tell me their business partner is launching a new venture and needs a developer. \"You'd be perfect for this, they're great to work with, we've been in business together for 6 years.\" I take the referral because of course I do. Good client vouching for someone, easy decision. First call with the referral and I can already tell something's off. Vague about requirements, keeps saying \"we'll figure it out as we go,\" but I push through because I trust my original client's judgment. Project starts and it's a nightmare. Constantly changing scope, wants daily updates, questions every decision, rude on calls. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"I found a template that does this in 10 minutes.\" \"My nephew said he could build this.\" I'm bending over backwards trying to make it work detailed documentation, extra calls, revisions I'm not charging for. Two months in I finally realize this isn't going to get better. I send a professional email saying I don't think we're the right fit, offered to transition everything to another developer, even gave them a partial refund for the hassle. They lose it. Email my original client saying I \"abandoned their project\" and \"wasted their time.\" Suddenly my anchor client is cold. \"You made me look bad in front of my partner.\" \"I vouched for you.\" Haven't gotten a new project from them since. It's been two months.\n\nThat referral didn't just cost me one bad client, it killed a $10K/year relationship I spent a year building. The thing that kills me is I don't even know what I was supposed to do differently. Keep working with someone who made every day miserable? Or stand my ground and lose my best client anyway? How do you handle nightmare referrals from good clients without torching the relationship? Or do you just never take referrals?",

The only time that you can really end this relationship with the bad client without upsetting the other client is to make sure that you don’t take on a bad client.\n\nOnce you have a bad client, you have to stick to your process. You have to make them follow your process. They will probably get annoyed with your process if they’re a bad client, and if you’re lucky, hopefully they’ll fire you and not ruin the relationship with your good client. You gotta try to figure out how to get it to a mutual understanding, not you firing them as a client.",

If you need time to decide what you want or what you need that's fine, and if you change your mind while we work we can stop and I'll quote out the changes and upon your approval of the new quote I'll continue. However if you're unwilling to define exactly what you want I can't then appropriately quote and charge you for the work.\"\n\nThen demanding to set his expectations before you guys started and if he couldn't have that then cut it off before it started. \n\nThings like \"now we have the exact scope of the project you want, it's gonna cost 5000 and take 12 weeks.\" I personally always pad the time I actually think it's gonna take, for mechanic work I like to give myself an extra hour so I look good when I finish under that or when I encounter problems unplanned for it's not quite so bad when I tell the customer I need more time cause this bolt was rusted and this one broke off etc.\n\nFinally with the daily updates I would have told him \"Sir you're not my only customer, I'll have your work done in the time frame I gave and I can provide a once a week update as I have other customers and some days I might be working on their projects and some days I'll be working on yours so daily updates won't be productive and just cost me time I could be using to work on your project to tell you \"I coded some letters\". Or \"I am working on someone's else's project today\".\n\nThe other junk he said about the templates and his nephew said something my reply to those comments are \"Ok then why did you choose to hire me instead of doing that?\"\n\nThe psychology of that is using the why questions to make the customer justify in his head why he was right to hire you and it has them define to you what pain points and problem he thinks you're solving for him. Then you take those and use them to point out and rejustify your value to him. \n\nWhile there are plenty of Karen and obnoxious ass hats I find you can either put them in line with strict procedures and rules while setting expectations clearly ahead of time or they will say \"Well I don't like that\" and you simply reply with \"Well I'm not the only web designer on the planet, if you want someone else to do this project who will give you daily updates you can find someone else who will as I am probably just not the right fit.\".

After that, if they want to refer, I tell them to point the person at my web site for intake and go from there.\n\nReferral: I start with the intake and proceed as though it it's a cold call from a random.  If they start trying to play games (not answering questions, not being specific, implying that they expect special treatment, etc.), I immediately move into the \"I'm really busy right now and I am speaking to you as a favor to 'referrer', but honesty I don't think I can help you right now.\" and send them on their way.\n\nIf existing client asks, I just say \"I couldn't take on the work and maintain quality of my other clients based on some of their expectations.\"",

Use that data to create an FAQ or addendum to contract or discovery call checklist or whatever. It's your business. You're in charge. Yes, you need clients and income but you get to decide who your best client is, know why that works when it works, and require courteous and professional engagement within boundaries you set. \n\nGood luck!",

She also sold them for a dollar more than I did, she also sold out and I just feel so beat down. We eat lunch with a group together and she was talking about how she’s such a great entrepreneur and since she’s so successful she’s going to sell every single week, and talking about her future flavors and I kinda just stayed silent.. what am I supposed to do with this situation? :(( should I keep going or just don’t bother selling again? Should I keep my prices the same or up it to be the same as hers? I’m really lost. ",

If there’s one thing I learned it’s that the successful business people are not the ones that start, it’s the ones that persevere. Let her do her thing, I guarantee she’ll fizzle out in a week or two. Observe, take notes, improve on the recipe/presentation/packaging/posting. Refine your product and launch with a vengeance. The most important thing is to keep at it, that’s where the magic happens. Results are spotty at first, but the longer you stay in business, the smoother it will flow to you. Get a nice process going, start taking orders so you’re not wasting product. Get serious about it, people may laugh and talk down on your business - they’re just jealous they don’t have the cojones to do what you’re doing. One day you’ll be a great entrepreneur!",

I’m not saying you’re not justified in being upset in your situation…I’m actually pissed for you. But I just got to the point where I look at it as “immitation is the best form of flattery”, and if they’re so unoriginal or inexperienced that the only way for them to get business is to steal others’ work and rebrand it as their own, then their business isn’t based on any of their own talents and is likely to fail when they’re eventually forced to come up with their own ideas. \n\nThe only thing you can do in this situation is keep doing what you do, but do it better and better every time. Competition is healthy and there is nothing wrong with another business owner taking up space in the same marketplace (although your situation is definitely more complicated than that). But in order to stay on top you need to remind your customers why you are the better choice and offer them things that are unique to just your business. \n\nI know you’re seething right now. I would be too. And I know it probably shot your morale too, which makes it harder to be enthusiastic. But I would come with something unique and different every single time.

          "body": "I'm so sorry this happened to you. It feels devastating, doesn't it?\n\nBut here's the thing. She can only copy you. The smart entrepreneurs (YOU!) \\*create\\* - everyone else copies. When you have time, come up with unique recipes. Also, don't call the cakes by the same name you saw in the book or video you learned it from: \"brand\" it by calling it something unique. So maybe a ginger carrot cake becomes a SpiritedAd Sugar 'n' Spice cake (add a tiny grating of nutmeg for a hint of a flavour) - unless she's got a good palate, she won't be able to reverse engineer that and make knock offs.\n\nBut really, in a way, you should thank her. You proved that a market exists for the mini cakes. She ran with the idea and proved you were selling too cheap, that the students would happily pay more for the exact same thing. So next time, price it at HER price. DON'T think going cheaper is the solution. MATCH her. \n\nThat way, she's got to either keep upping her prices to keep feeling superior (she isn't - you guy have a captive audience in school, is all), or she's got to come up with her own ideas.\n\nAlso, here's the reality: you baked the mini cakes because YOU had an idea. Guess what - that makes \\*you\\* the entrepreneur, not her. She's simply a copycat. \n\nIf you enjoy baking, keep doing it. You'll get better the more you practice. And baking, once you understand the basics, is SUPER versatile. You can come up with SO many ideas, she'll always be following, not leading.\n\nOther things you can offer: cookies, protein bars (these can get expensive, so watch out), brownies (with things like sweetened shredded coconut in them for texture, or made with condensed milk for an extra \"undefinable something\"), macarons, those rolled no-bake sweets, and more. Even mini-cakes with chopped up candy bars inside can be a differentiator - again, with your own branding, she won't know what you made!\n\nThe bottom line is, you're the trail-blazer. Keep up with your grades for now, and keep experimenting with baking (and with cooking!). Keep selling to your schoolmates - ignore what she's doing, because there's room for both of you. Instead of looking at her as competition, just note what prices she's offering her goodies at and go equal. NEVER compete on price.\n\nBy the time you graduate high school, you'll have proven to yourself that you have the chops to be a successful business. Focus on things like understanding your margins (how much it costs to make the goods compared to the total you get from selling a batch - that profit margin is what helps you do things like pay taxes, insurance, building rent, etc. as an adult with a business. (If your family has a Costco membership, go with your parents the next time they head to Costco, and check out what fun ingredients you can put in your goodies.) Take business courses if they're offered at school, otherwise, definitely look into YouTube videos - there's SO much you can do even as a high schooler. \n\nRight now, for example, you can literally use AI to start a small business online and get super successful and she won't even know about it. Go to ChatGPT, tell it what your strengths are, and ask it for suggestions for businesses you can start with no cash, no fancy equipment. There are kids making money even just creating social media videos for businesses: a real human showing off how they use the companies products is WAY more appealing than a formal ad. If you do this, look up videos about making UGC for Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.\n\nSorry this is so long - your post just struck a chord. I remember being a teen and wanting SO much to do something big. You've got great instincts. Trust them, keep going. You're going to be a superstar one day!\n\nMy DMs are open if you get stuck and just want someone to bounce ideas off of!",

Find your specific style or niche, make it unique and totally you.  Keep practicing, take extra cooking/decorating classes, and think outside the box.  Add different items as well.  Try looking for local pop-ups and vendor markets.  Use this as creative fuel!  \n\nThe friend that tried a candle biz, called me a few weeks after starting her business and was trying to sell me her leftover supplies bc she realized it was hard work.  We are still friends and in contact.  The other friend who did jewelry wanted to go into business together after I’d already solidly established myself and wanted the business to be strictly mine.

          "body": "You’re not imagining it. This is very common on LinkedIn right now. High likes and comments don’t mean buying intent. Most engagement is performative, people commenting to stay visible in their own network rather than because they’re interested in clicking, DMing, or purchasing. A lot of what looks authentic is driven by automation, engagement pods, or templated replies. Not always bots, but close enough that it feels real and still converts to nothing.\nShared posts are especially weak for results. LinkedIn aggressively suppresses outbound links, and reshares almost never drive referral traffic. Seeing zero visitors even with thousands of likes isn’t unusual. On top of that, commenters are rarely leads. Real buyers usually lurk, save the post, or Google you later. They don’t ask public questions or say they’re “interested” in the comments.\nWhat actually works on LinkedIn is slower and less exciting. Posting consistently from your own founder profile, speaking directly to problem-aware buyers, and treating LinkedIn as a conversation and positioning channel rather than a traffic source. At YellowInk, we only see results when businesses stop chasing vanity metrics and focus on message and positioning over 30–60 days.\n\n\nTL;DR: LinkedIn isn’t broken, but paid shoutouts mostly are. Your spend didn’t buy leads, but it did buy clarity.",

And friends/family usually don’t “get it” beyond generic encouragement.  \n  \nA few things that helped me:  \n  \n\\- **Find one operator friend** you can be brutally honest with. Doesn’t need to be same industry—just someone who understands cash flow anxiety and decision fatigue.  \n\\- **Recurring peer group** (monthly mastermind, local chamber, industry Slack). The consistency matters more than the group size.  \n\\- **Make decisions visible**: I keep a “decision log” so I’m not re-litigating the same worries at 2am.  \n\\- If you have the budget, a **therapist/coach** who has worked with founders is underrated.  \n  \nSmall practical tip: loneliness spikes when you’re stuck in reactive mode. Anything that reduces chaos helps.  \n  \nI actually built a tiny “client portal” with **Manus web builder** so customers can submit requests, I can track them in a **database**, and they get **notifications** when I respond. It’s not about tech for tech’s sake—it just removed a bunch of constant pings and gave me breathing room.  \n  \nYou’re not broken for feeling it. This part is just not talked about enough.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been doing ecommerce for a few years now, mostly behind the scenes, like ops, product sourcing, a bit of marketing, so I always thought, if anyone can run their own small shop, it should be me. Last year I finally decided to stop helping other brands grow and try building something that was actually mine.\n\nI didn’t quit my job or anything dramatic. This started as a side thing. My routine was pretty fixed: finish work around 7, grab takeout, sit on the couch, laptop on my knees by 9. That was my business time. At first it felt kind of exciting, like I was stealing time back from my day.\n\nThe idea itself was simple. Products I already understood, suppliers I’d worked with before, nothing fancy. What surprised me was how emotionally exhausting the small decisions were. Naming the brand took me three nights. Pricing made me second guess my entire career. I’d tweak product descriptions at 1am, wake up the next morning and hate every word. After making all those product related decisions, I kind of stalled for a while. I kept questioning whether I could actually run an online store at all. But I’d already put in a fair amount of time and money, so backing out didn’t really feel like an option. I don’t know much about frontend stuff, and hiring someone would’ve been another expense, so I just figured things out on my own. I learned to use Genstore to build a pretty rough first version of the site and then started doing some basic promotion on social media.\n\nThe real punch came after launch. Friends would say “wow that’s cool” and then no orders. Or one order, followed by three days of silence. I’d refresh analytics more than I’d like to admit. Every small cost suddenly felt loud: packaging, transaction fees, refunds. \n\nWhat I didn’t expect is how lonely it feels. At work, if something flops, it’s a team problem. Here, every mistake feels very personal. If a product doesn’t sell, it’s not the market, it’s my judgment. Some nights I honestly miss just clocking out and not caring.\n\nI’m still running the shop. It’s not huge, it’s not freedom, and it definitely hasn’t replaced my income. But it changed how I see small businesses. From the outside it always looks clean and aesthetic. From the inside it’s a lot of quiet doubt, tiny wins, and arguing with yourself at midnight.\n\nSo how others here deal with that mental side. Not the logistics or tactics, but the constant second guessing. Does that ever go away, or do you just get better at living with it?",

You have no certainty on where you’ll end up, the end result can look completely different from what you envisioned originally as you fix the problems along the road. \n\nThe second thing is joy. If it’s stops bringing you joy, it’s game over. You gotta keep playing the game because you want to, not out of obligation. That’s the fastest way to drain the spirit out of anything. If you don’t want to do it anymore, don’t do it anymore. Usually one or two days of quitting gives you clarity on whether it was a slump, or there’s serious weight to your concerns.

Even 1 sale is more than you had previously. And revenue generating. With just that new reframe you can rethink how you perceive these issues being the owner. Think about the progress. One day you didn’t have a business. Now on a different day you have a business! That is progress to be celebrated. Now carry that to orders and all the new things you get to learn and do. These are all new levels of understanding that you’re GAINING. You’re learning that strangers will support you more than friends and family. Everyone goes through that. It’s all progress, learning and new understanding! So just shift your focus a bit and practice gratitude that you’re on the journey that is your startup. Document it. Relish in it! Take pride in it and you’ll learn to be grateful for all of it! The good is just as valuable as the bad so try not to get too attached to outcomes but the process unfolding itself",

A payment service that ranks well on Google might be invisible when someone asks ChatGPT for low-fee wire transfer options. We track this visibility gap through CoreMention (https://coremention.com) - it shows how different sources perform across traditional search vs AI search.\n\nFor finding business tools, understanding both channels matters.

If you are upgrading the space while using, be sure to see if the landlord would provide a TI allowance. All fees, should be in the lease ahead of time. If they are not, then I would get a provision added that \"fees that are not defined in lease exhibits\" are responsibility of landlord. \n\nTake ample time in the beginning to negotiate the lease, it will save you a ton in the long term.",

          "body": "I own a commercial property on one of, if not the most, busy street in my city on the corner lot of a traffic light. The few times tenants have moved out in the 5 years I've owned this property, the vacant spaces have been rented out in under a month. \n\nI am a small time RE guy, but I do business with other people how I like others to do business with me. I don't like to waste others and my time and beat around the bush when it comes to doing business. My contract may be a tad lengthy, but I disclose EVERYTHING. Base rent, rent increase, lease duration, cam charges and percentages, signage and monument regulation, late payment, lease breaking, useage of the building, parking lot, inside and outside maintenance, plumbing, and even hvac.\n\nMost of the contract is non-negotiable. The only things I really negotiate on is length of the lease and options for lease extensions. I also add an updated exclusivity clause for the new tenant so they don't need to worry about me renting out to a similar business.\n\nSo my contract is pretty pretty binding and breaking lease triggers a payment of the remaining months of the lease, but I feel like our pricing per square foot is VERY fair and since everyone knows what they are getting into up front, people are always interested.\n\nAlso, I've only had 2 tenants move out. The first because the people hired by the tenant just weren't pulling their weight and the tenant wanted to be an absentee owner (of a new business 🙄) and the second because they fulfilled their 3 year lease and did well and wanted to move to a larger location (who I was super happy for). The one who is my current longest tenant currently has a 10 year lease with 2x 5 year options. 😁👍",

I don’t hate marketing, I hate the _constant treadmill_ of “be interesting on demand.” What helped me was reframing it as ops:  \n  \n\\- **Batch one day/month**: film 10 short clips, take 30 photos, write 10 captions. Schedule everything.  \n\\- **One format, one platform**: pick the easiest thing you can repeat (before/after, FAQ, quick tip). Consistency beats novelty.  \n\\- **Reuse**: one longer piece becomes 5 shorts + 3 posts + a newsletter snippet.  \n\\- **Lower the bar**: “good enough” content that answers customer questions often outperforms polished vibes.  \n  \nAlso: if you’re relying on social for leads, it feels extra punishing because your work disappears in 24 hours.  \n  \nA workaround is to push people to something you own. I used **Manus web builder** to set up a simple site with **lead collection/management** (quote requests), an FAQ, and an **AI chatbot** that answers common questions when I’m offline.

Invoice matching is one of those tasks that feels “simple” until you’ve lost a Saturday and realize your brain is now spreadsheet mush.  \n  \nA few ways to reduce the pain:  \n  \n\\- If you use QuickBooks/Xero/etc, check whether your bank feed rules can auto-match by vendor + amount + date window.  \n\\- Standardize vendor references: require invoice # in the bank transfer memo (or use virtual cards per vendor).  \n\\- Move vendors to **ACH + auto-pay** where possible; fewer manual exceptions.  \n\\- For the stubborn cases, set up a lightweight intake: every invoice gets uploaded into one place the moment it arrives.  \n  \nIf you’re even a little technical (or willing to prototype), building a tiny internal tool can help. I’ve seen people use **Manus web builder** to create a private “invoice inbox” app with **authentication**, a **built-in database** for invoice metadata (vendor, due date, amount), and **notifications** for “unmatched after 7 days.” It won’t magically connect to your bank by itself, but because Manus supports **code export**, you can later wire in Plaid/CSV imports or whatever your bank supports.  \n  \nThe goal isn’t perfect automation—just turning 47 manual matches into 5 exceptions you actually have to think about.",

When a client asks how to do something in app or website, just record your screen while completing the task (can be without audio as well), upload the video to video2docs, and it automatically generates a written guide with all necessary screenshots from it, which you can refine if needed in app before the final export. 📑\n\nWe built it based on our own needs.

While these methods can work, they often require a lot of manual effort. That’s where [WebIeadr](https://webleadr.pages.dev) comes in. A platform where web designers, developers, SEO specialists, and similar professionals can easily find and contact web design leads such as businesses without websites, in just a couple of clicks, along with many other features (check the website to explore all of them)!\n\nWebIeadr offers a one-time, credit-based system: **$12 for 100 business leads**. No subscriptions or recurring fees: pay only when needed. Credits stay in your account and can be used anytime, with options to buy more as needed. For example, if 40 out of 100 leads lack websites and 15 use third-party services (e.g., Facebook), and you secure just a mere 3 clients with basic sales skills, you could earn around $2,000. Your cost? Just $12\n\nThe bottom line is that WebIeadr offers an extremely quick and efficient solution to find web design leads in just a few clicks and **call them in just one click of a button**. From there, all you need to do is apply your sales skills to convince them that having a website is a worthwhile investment for their business.\n\nKnow a web designer, developer, or SEO specialist who could benefit from this? Please share this post with them. They’ll thank you later!",

Here's how it works:\n\n* You send me your top 3-5 vendor contracts/invoices OR we have a quick 15-min call\n* I analyze them over 2-3 days\n* I show you exactly where you're overpaying (usually $30K-$100K)\n* I give you specific strategies to capture those savings\n\n**No cost. No pitch. No obligation.**\n\n**Why free?** I need case studies and testimonials to build my practice. If I find real savings and you want help capturing them, we can discuss working together at that point. But the audit itself is completely free.\n\n**Best fit for:**\n\n* 50-300 employee companies\n* Significant vendor spend (software, services, IT, supplies)\n* No dedicated procurement person\n* Want to reduce costs but don't know where to start\n\n**What you get:**\n\n* Report showing specific savings opportunities\n* Dollar amounts for each vendor\n* 15-min call to walk through findings\n\nI've led vendor consolidation projects that saved $340K+ annually and managed 50+ vendor relationships. I know how to find money on the table.\n\n**DM me if interested!** I'm limiting this to 10 companies so I can give proper attention to each one.\n\nHappy to answer any questions below.",

      "selftext": "I've been running a small service-based agency for three years, and my biggest bottleneck has always been the \"discovery call\" friction. We used to have a standard Typef⁤orm setup - name, email, what do you need - but our conversion rate is dropping. I've noticed that when I'm a customer, I hate filling out a form just to wait 24 hours for a custom quote that ends up being way out of my budget anyway.\n\nI'm thinking about replacing our main lead gen form with a dynamic price calculator or some kind of interactive ROI tool so people can see the value (and the cost) upfront. Has anyone here moved away from static forms to these more utility-based lead magnets? I'm looking for something that can handle complex logic without me having to hire a developer to hard-code it into my site. Is it worth the setup time or do people find calculators too gimmicky?",

          "body": "Companies that hide pricing behind a quote button never get my business. \n\nI realize that not every business can provide exact pricing for services, but too many use that as an excuse to hide pricing. \n\nWhat I've liked in the past is when a company provides a white paper or blog post about a project then provided a breakdown of project costs and a total. This way I could see what the company charged, I got the benefit of seeing a completed project with progress photos and a good description of the work done. \n\nThis gives me an idea about what my similar project could cost while building trust in a company. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but gaining qualified customers should be a priority vs just getting random RFQ clicks. \n\nIt would be amazing if companies that build websites and marketing campaigns explained good metrics and KPIs vs the bullshit metrics and KPIs that small businesses have been trained to rely on for determining if their campaigns are successful or not.\n\nEdit to add: I built websites and online apps for 28 years for marketing agencies. It always pissed me off to hear the stakeholders given metrics about \"time on site\", click thru rates that don't matter, and page views as metrics that meant a campaign was successful. They mean shit to be honest. Then there was that phase where every bit of content had to be within 3 clicks of a home page. Like seriously WTAF? Properly indexing your content into appropriate buckets and having a logical hierarchical structure is more important than shoehorning disparate content wells next to each other confusing both search engines, your internal search, and the end user about the actual context of a page or section. I wish more agencies were honest about KPIs and how they actually matter to the end result.",

B2B educational content. Even at that low volume I’m struggling because each video takes 8-12 hours to edit. Want it professional for corporate clients.\n\nBeen looking at business video editing services and price range is INSANE. Seen everything from $50/vid freelancers (sketchy quality) to premium video editing agencies $500-1000+ per video. Not sure what’s reasonable.\n\nOther small biz owners when did you make the call to outsource? What was tipping point? How do you balance quality content with limited time/budget when not making YouTube money yet?\n\nI know video ROI huge for B2B but also bootstrapping and need to be smart with money. Would love real experiences from people in this position.",

          "body": "The tipping point math is straightforward: what's your hourly rate on client work versus the hours spent editing? If you're billing $150-200/hour for consulting and spending 10 hours editing a video, you're effectively paying $1500-2000 in opportunity cost per video. Even a $500 editor is a massive arbitrage.\n\nThe quality tier that makes sense for B2B educational content is probably $150-300 per video. You don't need motion graphics or fancy effects, you need clean cuts, good pacing, and professional audio. The $50 freelancers on Fiverr are hit or miss and the revision cycles eat any savings. The premium agencies are overkill for 8-10 minute educational videos. Our clients doing similar content usually land in that middle tier with a dedicated freelancer they've built a relationship with.\n\nThe finding process that works: post on Upwork with a specific test project, review 5-6 editors, pay for one video from your top 2-3 candidates, compare results. Once you find someone good, lock them in with consistent work. A freelancer who knows your style and preferences gets faster and better over time.\n\nThe ROI question you're wrestling with is real but probably backwards. You're not making YouTube money yet because you're producing at unsustainable volume. 2-3 videos monthly is the minimum for growth, and if that pace burns you out, you'll quit before the channel gains traction. The outsourcing cost is what makes consistency possible.\n\nThe weekend time is the real cost. You started a consulting business presumably for some autonomy, not to spend every weekend editing videos.",

It's just going to take time, lots of learning curve, healthy failures, and most importantly: bootstrapping/spending savings without income replacement before I generate revenue. \n\nWould love to hear from folks who were recently in a similar situation (i.e., went all-in on a business without having one already started as a side hustle + are in their first year of it). \n\nAny positive stories to share?

Do to this a side hustle wasn't really an option, so it was go all in or don't. \n\nIt's been an interesting time, and I'm glad I made the jump.  It's not been stress free, there have been multiple issues that made me stop and wonder if I made the right decision.  But you stick it out, adjust, and make it work. \n\nRemember there is alot that goes into running a successful business besides actually doing the work.  There is bookkeeping, advertising, taxes, networking, ect...  If you are like me and are doing this solo, you are on your own. It doesn't sound like a ton, but when you're flush with work it stacks quickly.  \n\nBe detail-oriented.  It will help with multiple aspects, especially when doing your books. \n\nDo NOT underestimate the cost of insurance. Not just for the business, but your health insurance as well.  Last year I paid over $25k for my family's health insurance, its fucking expensive. \n\nThere is ALOT that goes into it, but what you get out is worth it. I was in business for 9 months last year and made about $200k in revenue.  My profit margin is about 60%, so I did ok.  This year I'm working on optimizing, growing my customer base and offered services, and investing in productizing an automation solution.\n\nIt can be done, but you have to have your heart in it.  That's important because there will be many times your head tells you to give up.   Good luck!",

We're very knowledgeable in our craft (working in tech revenue operations) so we opted to go into consulting versus building to have a steady cash flow.\n\nEach year we've learned a ton of things and almost had a 'theme' to it.\n\nYear 1 was about figuring out how to be a business. Figuring out our pitch, our messaging, our artifacts (eg. SOW), and all of that was all new. We also had the benefit of having a wide network with some translating to be some of first few clients. This allowed us to hire (and fire) people as needed.\n\nYear 2 was about learning how to execute. Still riding off of our network, enough word of mouth about us allowed us to hire more people. This was an interesting time since we were still figuring out how to deliver but also need to figure out how our team members can lighten up our load. At this point we were starting to feel like it was a business.\n\nYear 3 was about scaling and the harsh truths about business. Year 3 was by far the toughest. We've scaled to have a great team, we've gotten some good projects out but the reality is that nothing stays good forever. Client churns really affected us. Bad contracts that we signed got us on the hook for hard deliverables with minimal returns. Poor fiscal planning also caused us to close up shop. You have to remember that being business owners also means that multiple families now depend on your business for their livelihood -- which was personally for me was a very heavy responsibility and the real threat of closing up shop was a tough pill to swallow. We've made it out well after a very rocky start and blessed to live and tell the tale.\n\nYear 4 is where we're at now and the theme will be GTM (GoToMarket) this year. Our network is starting to dry up and we have to pivot to direct to customers at this point. As business owners, I can say that we've gone through quite a bit of battle scars. We're wiser but we still have lots to learn. This year we've beefed up our cash reserves to make sure we're able to navigate through hard times while preserving our team that we truly love working with. I personally am figuring out how we can perform marketing and be a good boss. We've expanded our skill sets to blend AI and RevOps together to actually build stuff that is valuable and not just junkware.\n\nSo it's been a wild ride so far. There were more rough times and rosy periods but the people you meet along the way, the experiences that you get exposed to, the hard decisions that noone else could make -- all these things, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nBe ready for a ton of sacrifices. It's not just time and effort. It's also relationships, mental and fiscal sanity.\n\nWould I do it again knowing what I know? I'm not sure. Financially, you don't get to see the returns until the end (I would 100% make more money working for a software company given my skill sets) so it's hard to say. Professionally, being your own boss is both awesome and a curse. Mentally, I've definitely developed to be more stoic but pretty sure that I'm also starting to develop bi-polarism lol. You'll miss your family, your friends, yourself.. but when you're there you also come to understand how privileged to have something that's growing regardless of the outcome -- so maybe the journey is the reward.\n\nGood luck to you brother/sister!",

          "body": "I'm just beginning my third year as a solopreneur.  As others have said, it's a blessing and a curse.  You are your own boss, you eat what you kill (for better or worse), you don't spend as much time with your family as you would like, you don't get paid vacation, etc.  Health insurance is beyond brutal, like eye-popping brutal.  But you are building something for yourself, and you can take on whatever kind of business you like, and do it in the way that you think is best for the client.\n\nI used to lead finance at a few high-growth, VC-backed startup companies.  I got fed up with the BS of internal politics and the pressure to run things differently than I wanted to.  So I took some time off to clear my head, then gradually stepped into doing \"fractional\" CFO work.  I get to do the kind of work I love, all day, every day, and I don't have to sit through hours of internal meetings that add little value.  My clients are SO appreciative of what I do for them.  I rarely heard \"thank you\" when I was in-house at my prior companies.  I hear it all the time now.  I've been able to leverage my network to get clients, I've never had to advertise or even solicit business in any way, people actually come to me via word of mouth, and my clients refer me to their friends unsolicited because I do great work for them and genuinely help them solve problems.  The work is way more rewarding than my old job, despite me actually performing the same job as before, just in a different way.\n\nIt took me about a year to replace my prior salary.  I probably could have done that faster but I wanted to gradually step into it and enjoy the early days.  It's been hard work but quite fun.  I haven't even leaned fully into it.  I've been approaching it as more of a lifestyle business where I'm less concerned with maximizing the opportunity and primarily just don't want to have a boss (though in reality it's FAR from a lifestyle business -- long hours and some stress when clients turn over and you need to replace them -- there will be good months and less-good months).\n\nI price reasonably, which works well for the smaller to mid-sized business I serve, but I don't compete on price.  My field is crowded with lots of subpar providers that often don't know what they are doing (posers), and the good providers are often both really expensive and inflexible in how they work with clients (e.g., they are often focused on providing scalable solutions with something of a one-size-fits-all playbook).  I fill the void in the middle, with more of an reasonable price + customized service to give people what they really want.  I could charge more for what I do -- possibly double -- and I will probably raise prices at some point this year, but not to anywhere near that degree.  Up until now I've just been so giddy about helping people and enjoying the ride of doing this on my own, that I haven't minded leaving some money on the table.  I have an abundance mindset: there's enough to go around for everyone, and at the end of the day, you can have anything in this world that you want, as long as you are willing to put in the work required to get it.\n\n  \nWishing you luck on your journey.  You've got this!",

          "body": "I worked conferences for years, and the swag item attendees talked about the most was mini Tic Tacs. They were cute and fun, and people loved them. On the other hand, reusable water bottles were a pain because they’re clunky for vendors to carry/ship to the event, and people have too many. Most stress relief stuff (stress balls, massagers, etc) also got left, as did anything wearable or decorative (shirts, hats, stickers, etc) where the main design was a random company logo. Wearables like shirts also ran into sizing issues. \n\nNotebooks and pens were popular for educational conferences or places where note taking happens. Umbrellas aren’t a guarantee, but if you have umbrellas on a rainy day people will love you. I’d also potentially recommend blankets/fans or something to help regulate temperature, because conference spaces are ALWAYS the wrong temp (usually cold in my experience)",
