      "selftext": "idk if this is just me but why do clients suddenly develop amnesia the moment money is involved 😭  \nhad this guy hit me up all confident like “yeah bro let’s do it, timeline is tight but budget is ready” (red flag #1 I ignored bc rent)  \nI do the work, send previews, he’s hyped. like FULL CAPS hyped. “THIS IS PERFECT 🔥🔥”  \ncool. I send invoice.  \nabsolute silence. man vanished like I summoned him with a spell that expired.\n\nI follow up after 2 days. nothing. a week later he replies “sorry bro got busy, will sort tomorrow”  \ntomorrow has now been 11 tomorrows. I see him posting stories. I see him active on LinkedIn. I see him commenting on other people’s posts like life is amazing. but my invoice? dead. cold. probably in witness protection.\n\nthe worst part is you start questioning yourself like did I mess up? was it not that good? should I have said something different? but nah… this happens WAY too often to be a coincidence. some people just like the idea of hiring freelancers, not actually paying them.\n\nanyway lesson learned (again): hype doesn’t pay bills, screenshots of “looks great” mean nothing, and if someone says “I’ll pay tomorrow” without a date… just mentally move on and don’t pause your life waiting. back to work I guess 🥲\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPeaceeee!!!!!!!",

I am not trying to make a huge income, just enough to treat myself occasionally, like self-care, short trips, or hobbies.  \n  \nI want to know what kinds of side gigs or part-time work others are doing. Are any of you earning extra from home, or juggling a second job that feels manageable? I would love to hear ideas that actually work.",

          "body": "Okay I know this is going to sound so redundant but being established on survey apps and having a good freelance skill is still the best way to go about it. So I'll give you an example of what I do to make at least $300-500 a month, it's really random and not consistent but works for me.\n\nI use a bunch of survey and play to earn apps during downtime like commute or before bed. That gets me around $80-120 most months. I mainly use Swagbucks and Babki which has both surveys and games so I can switch when one gets boring. Also throw in some other random ones when I see signup bonuses.\n\nThen I do small freelance gigs on Fiverr for excel work mostly data entry or reorgnaization. Some months I get 2-3 gigs and make $200, other months nothing. It's inconsistent but when combined with the apps it usually lands somewhere in that $300-500 range.",

If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simply because you don't have competition.",

They want a lease agreement in my business name and utility bill showing the business address. Problem is I run everything from home right now and all my utilities are obviously in my personal name not my LLC. My accountant said mixing personal and business addresses can be a headache for taxes too. I reached out to amazon seller support and they basically said without proper business documentation the verification could get rejected. Same thing with tiktok shop, their KYC process is apparently pretty strict about having legit commercial presence. I'm doing about $15k/month right now but want to expand to these bigger platforms. Don't really have the budget or need for actual office space, just need the documentation to pass their verification process.I really dont wanna get my account suspended later because of this since this is my side hustle i let it go to this point.",

You can learn the basics in a few weeks and start freelancing. Ive been doing email marketing for 11 years and its still one of the most in demand skills out there. All you need is a laptop\r\n\r\nFreelance writing – if you can write decent theres always work. Blogs, articles, website copy. Sites like upwork are competitive but once you get a few reviews it picks up\r\n\r\nBasic bookkeeping – if youre good with numbers small businesses need help with this constantly. Quickbooks isnt hard to learn\r\n\r\nVirtual assistant work – lots of entrepreneurs need help with random tasks. Not glamorous but steady\r\n\r\nThe faceless tiktok thing the other person mentioned can work but it’s a grind and algorithm dependent. Personally I prefer skills where youre getting paid directly for work not hoping for views\r\n\r\nWhatever you pick, spend the first few weeks actually learning it properly. Youtube has free tutorials for pretty much everything. Then start reaching out to people who need help\r\n\r\nBeing stuck at home is actually perfect for this. No distractions, full focus. A few months is enough time to get decent at something and start making money from it",

Obviously it fluctuates but on average I'd probably make $100-500 a week and spent maybe 10-60mins total per week (sourcing stuff, posting it and meeting people)\n\n\nMy process:\n\n\nUse warehousewatcher.com to find Amazon warehouse deals, alot of that stuff is 40% off + and is in like new condition. If you can't find a buyer you can always return it too.\n\n\nAlso if you go directly on amazon.com enter \"warehouse deals\" in the search field, this also lets you look through their warehouse items, however they've made it increasingly hard to see what's actually in stock without clicking on the item first. Another excellent way to source product is if you're lucky enough to have online auctions with local pickup near you. You'd be surprised how cheap you can get things simpl because you don't have competition.\n\n\nPlaces like maxsold.com list estate sales, auctions etc nearby Also places like canoe.com, keepa.com and camelcamelcamel.com are useful for finding lightning deals to flip as well. Just check camelcamelcamel to see how much it's worth regularly.\n\n\nRules, always meet in public, preferably somewhere you can get to withir 2 mins or less. And never leave until they say they've arrived. This way you don't actually waste any time if people decide to ghost you (which will happen)",

      "selftext": "I’d save a lot of workout reels — abs, hotel workouts, mobility stuff — and feel productive in the moment.\n\nBut when I actually got to the gym (or a hotel gym), I almost never used them.\n\nI tried a few:\n\nScreenshotting sets/reps (messy)\n\nWriting notes mid-workout (annoying)\n\nThe core issue wasn’t motivation — it was lack of structure.\n\nSaved content is not something you can actually follow when you’re tired and short on time.\n\nSo I built an app for myself:\n\nTake a saved workout video\n\nTurn it into a simple, ordered routine\n\nAutomatically add sets, reps, and rest so I could just follow it like a checklist\n\nI shared it in a couple of small communities to see if anyone related — and one person asked if they could get lifetime access and paid before the app even launched.\n\nThat was the real signal for me.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nPeople don’t need more workouts — they need help executing the ones they already save\n\nFixing a behavior gap is more valuable than adding features\n\nEven tiny tools can validate a real pain if they remove friction\n\nI’m still in beta and mostly just learning from early users, but this was a nice reminder that solving your own annoying habit can actually resonate with others.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share beat access.",

      "selftext": "I cannot finish large important projects\n\nI cannot finish large important projects, I know this is related to my trauma and CPTSD but I’m not exactly sure how.  I basically would like to improve my life and the only way I can do. This is to accomplish large important projects and goals, but I cannot finish. I’ve been trying to do this for more than a year.\n\nI will give you some examples: \n\nIt’s really important for me to start a side business that will actually generate meaningful income. I have exact anxiety and I’ve been diagnosed as having major depression yet I force myself to work on these projects every day. in the past year I’ve tried to start two businesses. I spent roughly 4 to 5 months on each business and they are currently at the state of being about 90% ready to launch.  I have a problem finishing the other 10% so that they are ready to present to the public, advertise to obtain new users, and begin taking payments and generating income.  The reason for this is, I work so hard on these projects and I put everything into them and become obsessed with them over the period of 3 to 4 months but by the end of that timeframe I have lost faith in my original business idea and don’t feel like the ideas will be successful in the marketplace so I just pretty much finish the businesses from a technical implementation, but I never put the finishing touches and make the businesses available to the general public. Instead, I start a new business and the cycle repeats itself.  \n\nFor instance, I made a mobile app at work so hard on it to get it up and running, technically with backend website with payment and user accounts.  At the end of several months, the app is ready to launch, but I have lost faith in my original idea, and I have no confidence that will even make money. So I never launch, instead, I start a new business.  The next business is an AI startup, I spent several months learning and programming and getting everything ready for lunch. At the end of several months, I realize that I don’t like my original idea anymore and even though the business is about 90% ready for lunch, I never follow through and now I’m thinking of starting a new business with a different idea.\n\nHow can I break this pattern? I’m considering hiring an accountability coach who will check on me and give me encouragement so I actually follow through on these projects. Is this a good strategy or am I just not disciplined? any comments appreciated.  ",

This sounds less like a discipline problem and more like you're protecting yourself from potential failure by abandoning projects before they can actually fail in the real world. Getting to 90% means you can do the work, stopping at 90% means something else is blocking you.\n\nAn accountability coach might help with the practical side of actually launching but it won't fix the underlying fear that's making you lose faith in your ideas right before launch. That's the CPTSD pattern you mentioned and worth continuing to work on in therapy.\n\nOne thing that might help is launching imperfectly on purpose. Like set a hard deadline that the next project goes live at 80% ready instead of waiting for 90%. It won't be perfect but it'll break the pattern of never launching. You can always improve it after it's live.",

Gig work works because you can drop it instantly, but the hourly upside is capped. I’d think in terms of async work, you can pause without penalty. Tasks like simple freelance operations, QA, content moderation, or even paid research studies fit that better than creative work. The real filter is not income type, it’s whether missing a message for 10 minutes breaks the job. If it does, it’s probably a bad fit for your situation.",

      "selftext": "I live about 3 blocks from a concert venue and my house has this long driveway that fits 2 cars easy. Never really thought about it until my neighbor mentioned people always park on our street during events.\n\nStarted listing it on one of those parking apps back in April and honestly its been the easiest money ive ever made. I charge $20 per event (shows are like twice a week usually) and people book ahead. Payment is automatic, I dont have to do anything except make sure my own car isnt there on event nights.\n\nVenue charges $50 for their lot so my pricing works. Had maybe 3 situations where someone showed up late or parked like an idiot but overall pretty smooth. The app takes a cut but whatever, still making around $160 a month for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nNow ive got a bit of money sitting aside from Stаke and im trying to think if theres anything I could add to elevate the whole thing so I can start charging more. Like maybe some security cameras or better lighting or idk what else would make people willing to pay $25-30 instead.",

At night and during weekends, I rent them on ClicknPark. So I'm kind of double-renting the same spots :)\n\nIn the meantime, the city removed a lot of parking spots from the streets, so the real-estate value of my parking spots is increasing.\n\nMy 2nd best so far is investing in the market. I used to have these complex strategies of having some dividend-oriented ETFs, and then reinvesting those dividents in 2 parts: a small part on buying more dividend-oriented ETFs, and the biggest part buying long-term growth ETFs like XGRO or XEQT. I was about 10% earnings, but now I've sold most of the yielding ETFs and started to buy XGRO, aiming for a long-term return. That being said, this is \"theoretical income\" because I've reinvested it all, so both concepts of \"passive\" and \"income\" are highly debatable.",

          "body": "Most realistic and achievable is easily just investing into the S&amp;P 500, or a group of dividend ETFs. You just need to figure out a way to get money in the first place to fund it first. In that sense, you could look into bonus arbitrage (basically like bank churning). You’re essentially exploiting companies that overpay for user acquisition. Like for example, a company pays a $30 bonus for a $10 subscription, which means you can profit $20 in under 2 minutes. \n\nIt won't make you rich, but it’s an easy couple hundred a month that can then funnel into ETFs. The only hard part is finding these offers before everyone flocks to them and ruins it. I currently use [bonusarb.com](http://bonusarb.com) to track current ones since it’s a free resource.",

You’ve already established that you make as much as your regular job per hour when you’re actively working and building your income stream but what you’re not accounting for is the fact that ‘some’ of that income is passive.\n\nIf you do nothing at all next month you’ll make $100 (ad revenue minus costs).  This is free money and while it’s not forever you could earn it for a long time and although you’re still small you’ve created a saleable asset.  I’m not up to date on what a YouTube channel sells for so someone else feel free to correct me but your channel is worth something like $3,000-$8,000.  \n\nNow if you add that into your hourly wages I bet you see things start to rocket and snowball getting your wages up into the XXX per hour range.  The best part is that you can compound, I don’t know what your growth rate is currently but you have one client now, what’s stopping you from having three by the end of the year?  Let’s grow that ad revenue 10% a month and get you to $500 a month by next year!  \n\nWhat happens when you get to 50k subscribers and you can easily add in another sponsorship stream and double or triple your income because of that added revenue.\n\nYou’re already making more than you would at your day job which is the biggest hurdle to overcome, now it’s smooth sailing to compound that growth.

One is to invest money and two is to have a business that gives you money. \n\nAfter that sure there are several small ways here and there but you will find that in order to actually generate considerable income you would either have to spend money or make a business, or both.\n\nIf you have around 300k in stocks you could make around 90k every 3 years approximately which is around 10%, and that if the stocks make sense. I suppose you don’t have that money so what’s left is actually building a business that you could automate later on, but even then, the minute something goes wrong, it turns to active income.\n\nIn other words, you either have a capital upfront (stocks, property even, etc) and make money on returns or you either  build a business that holds value and lasts.

I record once in English, then I make Spanish + Portuguese versions with AI. I’m not really building much infrastructure either — I’m using managed services so I can turn them around fast. I also lean into template-style formats where the structure/visuals are consistent, but the voiceover/script is still original and 60s+, so I can batch multiple languages without reshooting everything.\n\nIt’s not perfect, and I’m honestly surprised it’s working at all.

Stuff like content + monetization (blogs, YouTube, niche sites), simple digital products, or automation-friendly services. For example, niche websites with affiliate links or ads can start slow but compound once they rank. Same with YouTube or Shorts tied to a clear niche.\n\nAnother solid path is building or licensing something small but useful, like templates, scripts, prompts, Notion setups, or simple tools. You put the work in upfront, then sell it repeatedly. Even $10–$20 products don’t need many sales per day to hit that goal.\n\nReselling and arbitrage can work too, but it’s usually less passive and more operational. Good for cash flow, not always for freedom.\n\nThe biggest mistake is chasing “set it and forget it” from day one. Most things need a few weeks or months of effort before they level off.

YouTuber profitable gambler posted instruction &amp; has a discord too. \n\nYou can also collect daily bonuses of .20 - $1.00  at 20+ websites until you have enough to cross wash (gamble) &amp; redeem. They offer intermittent bonuses similar to welcome ones too. \n\nI don’t know how long these will be around. A few states banned them already. It’s an easy side hustle rn.",

Made little spikes of income here and there, nothing sustainable, nothing I could confidently grow.\n\nWhat finally started working was treating one thing like an actual product business instead of a quick win. I’d been curious about SaaS but assumed it was too “serious” compared to easy hustles. The only reason I even tried was seeing a bunch of small, bootstrapped SaaS case studies in [foundertoolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) that started from where I was: no audience, no funding, just skills and time. The difference with this route was that the first dollars I made were from people paying monthly for something that actually solved a problem, not a one-off trick. I followed a validation and launch sequence I found there: weekend idea tests, pre-sell a tiny group, launch across 20+ small channels instead of only one big platform, then commit to a few months of content to keep traffic coming.\n\nMy first product is nothing crazy. It’s a simple niche tool solving one specific workflow headache. MRR is just over $1,200 right now, but psychologically it’s a different world from one-time hustles. Revenue comes in every month without having to constantly find new buyers from scratch. The biggest surprise was realizing I didn’t need some viral idea or massive audience, just a boring, well-executed system. Seeing dozens of people turn that system into $1–10K MRR made it feel less like a gamble and more like a skill I could learn. It’s still work, but it finally feels like I’m building an asset instead of chasing the next tactic.",

Then payouts started trickling in. Nothing life-changing, but I’m a couple hundred dollars in now, just from people using the voice, and I haven’t touched it since the initial setup.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how front-loaded the work is. Record clean samples, follow the guidelines, upload, and then it just… sits there. Obviously not everyone’s voice will be in demand, but it feels similar to stock photos or music licensing, just with your voice and AI.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else here has tried voice licensing or other AI-adjacent passive income plays like this. And if anyone wants details on how I learned the process, feel free to comment interest in the inbox not sure mods would be cool with links in the comments.\n\nWould love to hear if others are experimenting with this space or think it’s just a short-term thing.",

Basically, building a Pinterest presence that drives traffic to affiliate offers or a simple blog. It’s much lower effort than selling physical items because you don't have to deal with shipping or stock.

Turns out there’s real demand.\n\nI sell across multiple storefronts and slowly build a reader base that follows my work. About half of my process uses AI, but the other half is creativity and editing. If you rely only on AI, you get buried in low-quality content fast.\n\nThis is very niche, and most people don’t make much. But it is possible. From what I’ve seen, there are quite a few people doing very well in this space.\n\nI also sell custom stories. They take more work, even with partial AI assistance, but I’ve made almost $2,000 this year from just five of those commissions.\n\nEdit: I learned everything through authormeta.com (the Erotica Author QuickStart Guide)",

You do the work once, then improve it over time. Not instant, but repeatable.\n\nContent + affiliates\nWriting posts, answering questions, or making short content that links to tools you genuinely use. Slow at first, compounds later.\n\nRoyalties / licensing\nStock photos, music, designs, or assets. Very competitive, but low maintenance once uploaded.\n\nAutomation of an active skill\nTurning something you already do (freelancing, consulting, teaching) into a template, resource, or product.\n\n\nAnything that claims “fully passive with no effort” is usually just selling the idea, not the income.\n\nIn my experience, the closest thing to passive income comes from building something small that keeps working even when you’re not actively chasing people.\n\nCurious what others here consider “passive”.

          "body": "You’re already doing really well for 17, seriously. Most people your age aren’t saving anything. First thing I’d say is don’t rush into a business just because you feel like the money needs to be doing something. A lot of people lose their early savings forcing ideas that aren’t ready yet. Short term, keep the cash safe and boring. High interest savings account so it’s not just sitting there doing nothing. That gives you flexibility and buys you time.\n\nIf you want to start learning investing, you can slowly drip a small amount into a broad market ETF just to understand how markets move. No need to go all in. Think education money, not get rich money.\n\nFor business, invest in skills before ventures. Learn something practical you can monetise later like sales, marketing, editing, coding, or even running small online pages. Skills compound way faster than most “passive income” ideas you see online. You’ve got time on your side. Protect the capital, build skills, and let opportunities show up instead of forcing them.",

Distribute it equally so that, for example, Abbie and coke and visa pay you every January, then in the second, third and fourth quarters. Then find three more aristocrats that start paying in February and the months following your January payouts, etc and do this untill your whole calendar year is filled out. Set as many as you can to reinvest the dividends everytime they pay out. Eventually you will see this snowball turn into an avalanche as the reinvestment compounds. Keep building. Always stack these aristocrats throughout the months based on their dividend payouts. These are boring stocks. No need to watch the stock market because you didn't buy them to sell them. They are old boring companies who have saturated the market. What is exciting is that these companies have been consistently paying quarterly dividends to their owners for 25, 50 years or longer. Buy every sector or choose to leave out the ones with evil practices. It's up to you but at the age of 17 you will be starting out the way Warren Buffet and Charlie Unger did so many years ago. You can also just buy the s&amp;p 500 index fund and set it to reinvest. Just keep adding when you can and retire early when it snowballs and you can live comfortably on the dividends alone. Then stop the reinvestment in your Schwab or fidelity account (whatever has the lowest maintenance fees) and let them dividends payout every month into your bank account. Move to the least war torn economy and make sure you have a will so your nut doesn't fall into probate.",

      "selftext": "Can we normalize putting salary info in job ads?\n\nLet's be honest, as applicants, we are not just looking for “opportunities.” We are looking for offers that make sense for our skills, experience, and time.\n\nI’ve been actively searching and I see hiring posts everywhere on company Facebook pages, here, on LinkedIn, and even on company websites. The role is explained, the responsibilities are listed, the culture is highlighted. But the pay is missing.\n\nSalary info matters. It helps applicants quickly understand if the role is realistic for them. It saves time for both sides. It allows candidates to honestly evaluate what they can bring to the table and decide if the role is worth pursuing.\n\nEven if you can’t share the exact amount, at least include a salary range. That alone gives clarity. From there, applicants can choose to move forward and negotiate if they believe they can deliver more value.\n\nNo one wants to go through multiple interviews only to find out the offer doesn’t align with expectations. Transparency from the start builds trust and attracts the right people.\n\nApplicants deserve clarity. And companies benefit from it too.",

So I've been looking at possible online careers.\n\nI've applied for a few internship/entry-level positions, considering especially the virtual assistant type of work, or entry HR stuff. I'm not sure about the path I should take though. What sort of skills I should try to develop. So I want to ask a few questions.\n\n1- Is my goal of eventually being able to make 1000 dollars or more by online work realistic? I'm willing to do 40 hour week for it\n\n2- I've been looking at internship/entry jobs for virtual assistant role, am I doing it right? Most internships look shady, sadly. I don't know how big that particular role is at the moment, market wise.\n\n3- Any recommendations on what sort of role I should try to train myself towards? Anything with a growing market?\n\n4- On 3, should I chase online certifications and whatnot or just try to land a entry job? Most people around here seem to have a low opinion of certifications.\n\n5- Any recommendations on which job sites I should frequent? I'm doing mostly linkedin and indeed, and trying to get very easy jobs for low pay on Upwork, to build some trust of my profile.\n\nPlease share your wisdom!\n\nAnd p.s. this online job finding thing is really wacky on your mental status.

Also tailwinds communities feature exposed my pins to thousands more people organically.\n\nSmartpin feature generates multiple design variations automatically which saves insane amounts of time vs designing everything from scratch in canva. I compared pins made with smartpin vs canva and tbh they performed about the same so now I mostly use smartpin cause its way faster.\n\nThings that surprised me: pinterest traffic converts better than google traffic for affiliate offers, people are already in research/buying mode. Comparison posts (Product A vs Product B) get 2x more saves than generic roundup posts. Vertical pins crush square pins, not even close.\n\nChallenges: Takes 4-6 weeks to see real momentum so don't expect instant results. Pinterest algorithm is inconsistent, some pins randomly go viral and others flop for no clear reason. Tailwind cost adds up but ROI makes it worth it once traffic scales\n\nFocusing on pinterest instead of just SEO was probably the best decision I made for this site, google is so saturated now in most niches anyway.",

A few directory submissions to get things going and \\~10 nice organic citations\n* 150 \"user\"/newsletter signups\n\nI am happy with this progress given it is early days. There is so much more content that can be generated. I should also be able to get more momentum going when I can give more focus: I've spent only about 3-4 hours/week on it since the site has been up and running.\n\nOn one hand, I am glad that I thought about things long enough to land on this niche. On the other, I regret not getting going sooner! I was probably subscribed to this sub for at least a year or two, just sitting on the sidelines. \n\nIf you're like me and wanting to \"just start\", I couldn't recommend it more!

      "selftext": "I kept seeing the same problem with Instagram creators: Good content, Decent following, Regular DMs, Very few sales, Most of them assumed the issue was: “Maybe I need more followers”\nor “My offer isn’t strong enough”\n\nIn reality, the problem was simpler.\n\nThey had attention, but no system for turning conversations into customers. \n\n&gt;Why followers don’t automatically become buyers\n\nInstagram is great at creating interest, but terrible at closing.\n\nMost creators rely on: Link in bio, “DM me if interested” (with no follow-up system), Manual replies that stop after 2 messages, The moment the conversation slows down, the sale disappears.\n\nNot because the person wasn’t interested but because there was no structure.\n\n&gt;Why DMs convert better than links\n\nDMs work because they: Feel personal, Require less effort than clicking links, Create momentum (reply → reply → next step)\n\nPeople ignore links.\nThey reply to messages.\n\nOnce I stopped thinking of DMs as “support” and started treating them like a conversion channel, everything changed \n\n&gt;What most creators get wrong with automation\n\nThe biggest mistake I saw: Generic automation. Long messages, Robotic replies, Same flow for every follower, People can tell when they’re being “processed.”\n\nThe funnels that worked best were: Short messages, Natural language, One clear purpose per step\n\nAutomation should feel like a helpful assistant, not a chatbot \n\n&gt;Real use cases I’ve seen work\n\nDifferent creators, same principle:\nCoaches → book calls from story replies\nEducators → sell digital products via keywords\nInfluencers → qualify brand leads\nAgency owners → pre-filter inbound DMs\n\nNo hard selling.\nJust structured conversations.\n\n&gt;The biggest mindset shift\n\nCreators don’t need: More content, More posting More followers, They need better conversations.\n\nOnce the DM flow was set up properly: Replies didn’t go cold, Buyers identified themselves, Sales felt natural, not forced\n\nIf you’re a creator reading this\n\nIf you’re getting: \n“Interested”\n“How much?”\n“Can you tell me more?”\n…but nothing happens after that\nyour problem isn’t your content.\n\nIt’s the lack of a system behind the DM.\n\nHappy to answer questions or break down an example flow if helpful.\nNot selling anything here just sharing what actually worked.\n",

If the owner gets lazy and starts to think they can afford to hire more people and the employees dont care cuz its just a job, quality goes down and regulars notice. or If the owner gets greedy, they start to pay themselves more, but dont plan on vital equipment needing maintenance over time. stuff like that can fail a business. people can make a bunch of money off restaurants and still let the business fail because they know how to start another one somewhere else.",

A lot of people are enticed by one (much like people are to stocks or gambling or sports, arts, politics, you get the idea) and wither without the other.\n\nPersonally we had a marketing (mostly signs, cards, flyers etc) store, a restaurant, barbershop, drugstore (convenience store? twice, among other side hustles. Some failed, some \"failed\" and some FAILED. For example the restaurant just didnt have a large enough clientele where we had it so we sold everything and mostly evened out. The brbershop worked but there was... scalping and some other shenanigans that forced us to close after a very large swindle involving a lawyer (that was 20 years ago tho). One convenience store failed because of bad timing and little cushion below it... a few more months and it would have been \\*quite\\* profitable as the zone boomed, but we ran out of money after a bit... less than two years iirc. The second one was completely mismanaged and none of us had time, it was qutie improvised, that definitely was a waste of money.\n\nGenerally, if you understand a business, have enough money and get a half decent spot, you will at the very least coover your expenses and get a little extra most of the time. I wont lie to you and say the majority of businesses are able to feed you, but a big big chunk in this gorup does. Its just that you might not be ok with merely an \"ok\" situation, at that point it is just a crappy job with no safety net either, but at that point you sell it to someone that wants something small to work on, someone ambitious would still chase the big bucks (and by big bucks I mean equivalent to a well paid profesional, bit more bit less.

There was nothing explicitly special with the place that demanded the price, and the dining space was no more interesting than a Chipotle.  It was offering nothing at all of value.\n\nThe region also kind of sucks because there is a LOT of fast food locations and a LOT of other restaurants all over.

Margins are razor thin, labor is expensive and let's just say attracts a certain mindset of person. And especially when a restaurant gets large, you need to hire managers to manage it for you and one or more bad managers can sink you rapidly by driving away customers and dramatically escalating your costs.\n\nAlso because the people who start restaurants usually aren't business people they don't plan for the future terribly well. They're focused on what's going to make money THIS WEEK and cover payroll, bills and so on. They're tactical thinkers because that's what a restaurant requires day to day... but the actual business of the restaurant requires strategic thought and planning. You also have to be able to step back and do proper financial analysis to figure out what's working and what isn't, and you have to be detached enough from the \"passion\" of the restaurant to even abandon things you thought would work but clearly aren't.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the business is cutthroat... and not just with other restaurants. For every restaurant there are a half a dozen suppliers who are all vying for their piece of the pie and most of those have very little competition in their particular field thanks to business consolidation. I use liquor as a great example, as a restaurant I would have to buy from a wholesaler but thanks to consolidation of businesses there are only like 3 wholesalers in town who all basically put the same prices on everything. It's shockingly easy to lose money on liquor too thanks to licensing and insurance costs, as well as the staffing and training (and wastage) that you will have with it.\n\nWith the economy the way it is, people have cut back drastically on going out to eat. It's brutal out there and I'm seeing so many restaurants literally on the verge of closing in the next few months. Most don't have cash reserves and are fighting the same uphill battles most of us fight in our daily lives; food costs are rising, utility costs are rising and in many areas rent increases are out of control. Literally my only saving grace with that restaurant is that I own the building and there are other businesses in that building that (mostly) cover the mortgage. \n\nI keep it going though so that my regulars can get their favourites, and so that my employees have a consistent paycheck. Business is 1/3 of what it was two years ago and we've had to make a lot of hard choices in order to keep it going. Even in the new year we SHOULD be raising prices because of the amount or food costs have risen since our last increase over a year ago. But we can't... if we do then any revenue increases will be offset by a reduction in volume of people coming in. 2026 is going to be incredibly hard for restaurants.",

But they won’t understand why people don’t visit their restaurant or avoid specific dishes. All the while, they’re paying utilities, wages, rent, and throw away pounds upon pounds of food. \n\n\nMost of all, they don’t think their restaurant will suffer the same problems as others: theft, no call no shows, poor talent pool, interpersonal conflicts, scheduling issues, inventory issues,  food safety violations, and poor reviews. \n\n\nThe people who are the hardest workers on earth could have critical flaws with handling finances, inventory, or employee issues. The people who are whizzes for financial stuff or connecting with employees could be the laziest person in the restaurant. It’s rare to have all the pieces fall into place and work harmoniously. A fantastic chef can’t outweigh a terrible front of house experience, for instance. \n\n\nPeople simply think a restaurant is easier to run and manage than it is. Employee issues, ineffective management, and poor customer reviews can all be soul crushing. The unpaid bills just speed up how long it would have taken the owner to close up shop. The fantasy they thought they were building was a nightmare. The few tough months they were expecting, went on for years.",

      "selftext": "Hey,  \nMy girlfriend and I have been talking about starting a small business together and on paper it sounds great.  \nThe idea is a candle and home fragrance brand since she’s been experimenting with scents at home and selling small batches to friends and local markets and getting good feedback. We get along well and we both want the same long term outcome. The part that keeps me up at night is the risk side. I already own property and most of my savings are tied up there while she does not have assets yet. To get this business off the ground I would likely need to put my property on the line through a mortgage or loan and that feels very different when it is not just my idea anymore. I am trying to be honest with myself about whether this is a business concern or a relationship concern or both.  \nFor founders who started something with a partner when one person had more to lose how did you think through risk and boundaries before moving forward. I’d really appreciate any advice :)",

But is anyone on Reddit going to convince you not to do this? \n\nWhat you should listen to is all the people saying don't risk your assets. **You absolutely do not need to finance this business.** That's why these businesses are so popular; there is no expensive barrier to entry. You can probably get everything you need for years on Facebook Marketplace from someone who tried to do this and got bored. Get a logo for $100, set up a Shopify site and you're set. The biggest expense will probably be market fees to sell your stuff locally. \n\nI'd encourage you and your GF to put in $1,000 each or whatever makes sense. Set up the LLC, get an account, business credit card (that you pay off every month). Do all that shit right and if it works, great. If it doesn't, you're fine. And if your relationship implodes, you're both fine. \n\nAlso, you two should have a little book club it'll be cute.

It's inspirational but sanguine, she embodied scrappy early on and has a lot of good advice. \n\n* E-Myth Revisited, this is a book I recommend everyone who has or wants to have a business around making something.

But some don't and others make profitable side-gigs but not real companies.  \n\nYou're getting good feedback. Good feedback is irrelevant. Good sales are what matters. And sales beyond friends. You say local markets - not sure if you mean stores or farmer's markets. But keep those activities up. BUT you have to account for the value of the time for whoever is doing the marketing and sales. And whoever is doing the manufacturing. Pay that person what it would cost to hire a stranger for those jobs. Is there still profit? If not, it's a nice hobby. If there is plow all the profits back into the business - basically more marketing till you've maxed out your manufacturing capacity. Then spend some of that profit on ways to increase capacity a little bit. Then sell more till you max out that additional capacity etc. Keep this up till the profit is more than one of your day job income and you feel confident enough in the future to quit that job. But only one of you. \n\nAt some point you'll have to have an agreement who's going to be in charge of what activities, what decisions, what spending etc. Hash this out and WRITE IT DOWN. It may not be a legal agreement, but writing it will clarify your thinking and preserve your memory of what you agreed to. \n\nI would not put my property at risk at this point. I would not spend savings - unless I was prepared to lose it.",

Start small with money you can both afford to lose, treat it like a test phase, and see if the business actually works before anyone takes on debt or secures loans against assets. If the idea is good, it should survive a slower, lower risk start. If it can’t, that’s valuable information before things get serious.\n\nIt’s also worth having an honest conversation about boundaries and worst case scenarios now, not later. What happens if it fails, what happens if you break up, who owns what, and how decisions get made. That doesn’t mean you don’t trust each other, it just means you’re being grown about it. If the only way forward requires you to take on all the downside, that’s a sign to pause and rethink the structure, not push through the fear.",

Try making small batches, do not invest too much into something that is an experiment in it's essence.

Be honest about the financial, emotional, and time investment you’re willing to make. Make expectations explicit: who handles what, how profits and losses are shared, and what happens if disagreements arise. Written agreements are better than vague trust.\n\nDon’t let affection or fear of conflict drive your decision. Imagine worst-case scenarios/ If you could endure them and still live according to your values, then the risk is manageable.\n\nConsider starting small.

Testing the idea in low-stakes conditions is a very Stoic way to see if it’s viable before committing fully.\n\nEpictetus reminds us: don’t demand things go your way, but wish for them to go as they do.

Had little tangible skills so I started an apprenticeship with a local union at age 30 with the thought of working my way into the office as a PM someday. I now have zero desire to do that...the PM's at my medium-sized company make over 200k+/year but never stop working, and I know that's kind of the industry norm. Figured if I'm going to work all the time, might as well work for myself instead of making someone else rich.\n\nI'm now 32 and diversifying my skillsets with the intention to start my own business totally unrelated to construction. Best case scenario, by the time I finish my apprenticeship I will have a successful/growing business on the side that I can turn into a full-time gig. \n\nWorst case scenario, the business doesn't take off like I hoped but I'll still be a union journeyman making decent money. I'll make a living while I figure out my next adventure. \n\nI know you didn't ask for advice, but since we come from similar backgrounds and are the same age I feel compelled to share something I've been struggling/realizing lately: Reading self-help books is good but it will never replace actually doing \"the thing\", know what I mean? Those books make us feel good and artificially better for reading them, but they mean nothing if we don't practice their teachings. Don't get caught in that trap like I did. \n\nGood luck brother.",

There's a lot of money to be made doing things others don't want to do. Many property maintenance companies make more money than the property owners. Many plumbers make more than the home owner they service. Tons of people making 60k a year pay 300 once or twice a year to get their car detailed. And so on.

They are not bad, but they should be side bets, not the main plan.\n\nThe biggest thing I see is this. You are trying to fix your life by reading, instead of by doing. Reading is good. Learning is good. But at some point you need action, even messy action.\n\nYou do not need more self help books. You need one simple plan and execution.\n\nExample. Niche down. Pick one thing you can sell now. Property maintenance for landlords. Or small commercial buildings. Or busy homeowners who do not want to deal with repairs. Who is your target audience?\n\nThen do boring stuff. Simple website. Google Business profile. Ask past contacts for referrals. Charge fair prices. Do good work. Reinvest profits.\n\nThat alone can change your income within a year.\n\nThe people who really fail are the ones who never try because they think they are too old or not smart enough. You are already past that stage because you are asking questions and taking action.\n\n32 is not late. It is early for someone who finally knows they want more.\n\nYou are not inadequate.

The fact that you are reading daily, thinking in terms of skills and ideas, and already investing puts you ahead of many people who look “established” on the surface.\n\nI did not come from a strong educational background either. I learned most things by doing, failing, and restarting. I have had businesses that worked, then collapsed completely. At one point I went back to zero financially. What kept me moving was not some big breakthrough idea, but stacking skills that could transfer across industries.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is to focus less on hit or miss ideas at the beginning and more on skills that directly tie to cash flow. Property maintenance is a great example because it solves a real problem and people pay for that consistently. Once you have steady income, experimenting with games, music, or ebooks becomes way less stressful.\n\nI work in video editing, social media management, and media buying, and one thing I see constantly is that businesses do not need genius ideas. They need people who can execute, communicate, and stay consistent. Those are learnable skills, not things tied to formal education. I learned most of it online, through practice and working with small business owners.\n\nAlso, do not underestimate your construction background. It already gives you discipline, problem solving, and work ethic. You are not starting from scratch, you are pivoting.\n\nMany people who “made it” later did not have a straight path. They just kept moving, learning, and adjusting. If you keep building practical skills and stay patient, things do compound, even if it does not feel like it year to year.\n\nYou are not late. You are just early in the part where it feels messy and uncertain.",

Most people who actually build something real do it in their 30s or later, especially people without safety nets. You already have savings, income, work ethic, and ideas, that puts you ahead of a lot of people. Construction is not a weakness either, it gives you practical skills and a fallback, which reduces risk. The biggest mistake is thinking you need to “find the perfect idea” before starting. Pick one practical thing first, like property maintenance, get it cash flowing, then experiment with the higher risk ideas on the side.",

          "body": "I'll weigh in on this. I have nothing more than a high school education, and I completely shifted industries that I was working in, back when I was 32. My entire work history up until age 32 had absolutely *zero* relevance to the industry that I went into (real estate sales and property management, and property maintenance). For context, I am now nearly 50, and own &amp; operate two businesses; one of which is a handyman/remodeling business. \n\nI am still the key driver in each business, so I have a good ways to go; given that the goal is to build something that can function for weeks or months at a time without me around. I currently own my own jobs, and am not yet officially a \"business owner\" or \"entrepreneur\". I like to think that I'm on the right path, but have not \"made it\" yet. \n\nSo I've been toiling away for 18 years on this, so far. I've made some insanely big mistakes, that set back my progress in some significant ways. But I've also had some good fortune and not-so-bad decisions.\n\nMy short take on it: you have *plenty* of time to create huge success. And given your work experience and financial savings, you are better positioned than I was at your age. Time is definitely on your side. \n\nTo use the poker analogy: it sounds like you have a very good hand. Not an AMAZING hand, but a very good hand. If you play that hand super well, you could crush it. If you play the had moderately well, then you'll do pretty good. And if you play it poorly... well, you know.  \n\nAre you listening to the Contractor Evolution podcast? That's a good one, in my opinion, if property maintenance is definitely the direction that you want to go. \n\nAnother thought on property maintenance: you'll need to decide on whether you want to be self employed and doing the work yourself, or if you want to be running a business with employees. I've known a lot of self employed contractors that are doing far better financially than the small business owners. In my observation, there is a lot of success to be realized for the independent operator as well as the mid-to-large business owner; but the grey area in between... the small business owner... often struggles. That's because having a couple company trucks and employees requires a lot of time, energy, and money, and the profit margin on only having a couple of employees is barely enough to make it viable. So to make that business model a success, you have to get past that tipping point. \n\nAll of that is to say: being an independent owner/operator is a completely different paradigm from owning a business that has an office manager, service technicians, trucks, warehouse/office space, etc, etc. Both options can be financially successful, but they require vastly different skillsets, and you need to decide for yourself which option you want for yourself.",

The whole performative productivity thing. And I was miserable and the business wasn't even growing that fast.\n\nThe breaking point was a Thursday afternoon when I sat at my desk for 3 hours and literally couldn't make myself do anything. Just stared at the screen. Brain completely empty. I thought something was medically wrong with me.\n\nTalked to a therapist. She asked me what I did for fun. I couldn't answer. Asked me when I last took a day completely off. Couldn't remember. Asked me if I actually enjoyed running this business. I started crying which was embarrassing but also clarifying.\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you. Productivity systems are designed for people who aren't working enough. If you're already working too much, optimizing your work just means you burn out more efficiently.\n\nWhat actually helped was cutting my hours. Not optimizing them. Cutting them. I went from 70 to 45. Felt terrifying at first. Felt like I was abandoning the business. But the business didn't notice. Revenue kept growing at roughly the same rate. Some things just didn't get done and turns out they didn't need to get done.\n\nThe 25 hours I got back went to sleep, exercise, seeing friends, and just existing as a human. My actual productive output during the 45 hours is now higher than it was during the 70. I can think clearly again. I can make decisions. I don't dread Monday anymore.\n\nMore hours isn't more output. It's just more hours.\n\nAnyone else been through something similar?",

Will you be financially secure and emotionally happy with a one or two-person business? Or, do you want the potential wealth and satisfaction of building something bigger? Try to visualize both scenarios and see which one feels best. \n\nI offered the visualization advice to a client years ago, and she ended up leaving a position that would have given her a big financial bonus if she had stayed on for three more months. I was terrified that my advice had led her to make the wrong decision, but she has told me many times that she has never been happier.\n\nThere is also a middle ground - build your workload at a pace you feel more comfortable with. Turn down a job or two if you feel they would add too much stress. \n\nOne final thought, if you do decide to add another worker, consider looking at some of the vocational education programs at area high schools. Those kids are usually well-trained and motivated.\n\nGood Luck!",

Everyone knows he's a great artist, but nobody understands what makes him great it is not his paintings or sculptures. It is multidisciplanary mindset. He created infinite stuff from gadgets to fine art to papers, to business ideas. He had to learn all that by actually studying and experimenting. There were a lot of great fine artists, maybe even better than him at that time, but what made him an artist, is that he surpased them by knowing how to present himself, how to convince investors and the church and the government to give him land, how to manage resources, workers (who actually did all the work while he directed), and how to raise money. \n\nPeople just see the results and say, oh he's an artist cause he did this, without even analogizing the xyz factors that enabled him to do this. \n\nAn artist, or an entrepreneur is anyone who pushes the limits of what's possible in their domain. A banker can be an artist, a killer even can be an artist, no matter how unorthodox it sounds, or a tennis player, a developer, or an entrepreneur. Paradoxically self proclaimed artists are far from artists. they are more like hobyists, that have no need to exxplore the unknown, or try hard to change the status quo in their domain. (some) entrepreneurs do. These are for me the real entrepreneurs / artists that manage to actually do what they envision no matter the path.",

Who knows what, it was probably something totally insaine I wanted to do. \n\nI spend 2 days off from school trying to figure out how to make money until I found a bulk deal on those little snap rocks that come in the white paper people used to get on the 4th of July. I could buy them for 25cents as long as I spent $60 on them 😂 \n\nSo to me this was a no brainer. Except I had to \"borrow\" my mom's credit card. So I wrote out a plan on a piece of paper to figure out how many I needed to sell to pay her back before the next credit card bill. Calculated with shipping.\n\nObviously I got caught, the whole thing was a disaster. Turns out you can only sell so many of them until the same kids get board and the state decides you're selling fireworks.\n\nI managed to make back $50 in a little less than 2 weeks if memory serves me correct. \n\nMy dad yelled at me because he thought I wanted to play with the snap rocks and the money was secondary. But then I started yelling at him because as much as I wanted to play with them, to me they were valuable merchandise and a means to an end (I can't for the life of me remember what I was trying to get enough money to do just trust me, it was probably something I my parents would have been right to say no to)\n\nBut his accusation made me emotional because it underlined the pain of sacrificing for something that didn't work out and how unfair it was that I don't even get recognition for my discipline. When I was in middle school half of all I wanted was recognition and the other half was freedom. \n\nSo I'm in my room crying like a baby and my dad eventually is kinda like dude, the state dropped the charges (I shit you not), you're not kicked out of school, I didn't even ground you... What are you so upset about? (God bless my parents 😂) \n\nAnd I told him, I wanted to sell the stuff to get an Xbox (which was a lie but... Close enough) and he started telling me about all these businesses he tried starting with his friends. And all the issues they ran into between getting molds for products or certifications to make specific claims or having enough money for different rounds of testing and then trying to convince an investor to give him more money when they blew through it. By the end of that conversation. I realized this is what I was going to be good at one day. I loved learning about things, breaking them down to steps, business plans. The fact it's kinda like gambling but not really. I was a bit of a lonely kid so just the emotional stimulation alone had me hooked. \n\nI think being an entrepreneur is less of a skillset, not so much a state of mind, it's an alignment of interests with a compatible perspective.",

          "body": "I'm interested to hear everyone's reflections from childhood experiences where they found themselves entrepreneuring. Here's mine:\n\nIt took me until about 19 to call myself an entrepreneur (I didn't like the term before that for some reason), but then upon reflection I realized that I've been entrepreneuring my entire life instinctually.\n\nWhen I was 7 years old, all I wanted for Christmas/Chanukah (half-half family over here) was a cash register. Not sure if that's indicative of being an entrepreneur or because one half of my family celebrates Chanukah. That said, I ended up starting a \"video game business\" in my household where I took all my brother's xbox games, wrapped &amp; sorted them, then pretended to sell them to my parents.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old I was starting Minecraft servers and building out role structures, interviewing people to be moderators, setting up Discord channels, advertising the server on directories, working with players to improve their experience.\n\nAt 12, I started dog walking. About a year in, I hired all my friends to be dog walkers and turned it into a small business in our neighborhood where I got the new clients, earned a percentage of the walk, and managed the walking schedules.\n\nFrom 14-17, I worked at some companies doing customer service / other internships, and no matter what, I could not find myself being comfortable staying in one role for more than a couple months. I needed to create some kind of initiative at the company, move up, or learn something new.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I decided to start my own SEO consultancy and have since turned that into a creative + SEO agency (and I acquiesced to calling myself an entrepreneur).\n\nAll throughout those ages, I was creating new clubs at each school level (middle, high, college) and doing whatever I could to innovate what they offered. In high school, it was creating new arts organizations + initiatives; in college, it was creating the university's first true experiential arts event organization.\n\nNow I'm 22, graduated college with a degree in theatre/film and am running the agency - it would be impossible for me to live any other way.",

Before, someone always had to remember to log notes, notify the right person or move things along. Once that was automated, the workflow just continued on its own. Having Zapier in the middle to connect pieces meant fewer follow ups, fewer missed details and a lot less mental overhead. After living with that for a while, going back to doing it by hand feel like a step backwards.",

Combining personal and business in one system can actually create more headaches than it solves, especially come tax time or if you ever need to show financials to anyone (bank, investor, partner).\n\nThe messiness you're feeling with separate apps usually comes from not having a clear workflow, not from having multiple tools. A dedicated business account (even just a separate checking account) plus something like Wave or a basic QBO subscription keeps things clean without overthinking it.\n\nIf you're dead set on combining, Quicken B&amp;P handles the basics okay. The tagging system works well enough for categorizing business vs personal.

Do you even know anyone that is an inventor that lives off the money they make from inventing shit?Have you ever met anyone?\n\nOkay, so let's focus on things that already exist.You don't have to come up with a unicorn idea.You have to find value to bring to the marketplace.\n\nI own a company in commercial truck parts manufacturing and sales. I found a niche of parts, and sub divided it into a sub niche of 7 items with 28 configurations. I don't know shit about trucks or truck parts or any of that stuff, but I know all the stuff that you don't know. I just like that stuff, and I like business. You could say that i'm really good at it.\n\n The truck parts just happen to be the industry I worked in at the time. I find that if you seek your niche in the industry that you're currently working in, you have a higher possibility of finding it within months to a couple years of searching and researching. When you work at a job, you have insight to the industry and the behind the scenes stuff that the average person just doesn't whether it be in a restaurant or a law firm or a construction company. When I researched my part, I called the name on the bag. I also found out there was one other manufacturer. They are both made in america.... For every truck on the planet. They were the only two manufacturers. I worked at a diesel shop. So when I called them asking about pricing, they asked, how much a month we use, and eventually push me to a distributor. That actually gave me a list of all their distributors. I then called those distributors and got pricing. A week later, I called back the manufacturers to set up the diesel shop as a distributor. This gave us their distributor costs. So now I knew what wholesale and retail prices were. I understood.The volumes required to be a distributor from the manufacturers. And I had an idea of how many parts were sold per year.Based on all of that information. I was also able to get the purchasing people at a couple other parts distributors to call\nand go through the same process to verify my information.\n\nI double checked the manufacturing to make sure they were not importing them. Import Yeti is free to use.\n\nI have google so I could do some basic searches to figure out how many commercial trucks are on the road. I worked in a commercial truck repair shop that did the repairs that utilized these parts so I was able to find out how often trucks have to have these repairs made. I was able to find out that this part has not changed in design since trucks were invented. I also found out that the seven that I chose out of hundreds were the universal components that fit a majority of the trucks. They're also required. Their non safety facing, so I don't have to worry about anyone dying. I sent some of them off to a lab to have mass spectrometer materials composition testing and made prints of each. \n\nI utilized import yeti to identify factory clusters in China, India, and Mexico that manufacturer's similar items.\n\nSteel, Zinc parts with strict tolerances, stamped, machined, cast, and plated.\n\nAfter researching factories, I understood what I was looking for in my own factories.\n\nMaterials, processes, in-house tooling and die making, QC testing capabilities, certifications, 3d printing, and packaging/labeling in-house.\n\nI found three factories in china that I reached out to via email. I also found a factory in taiwan that I used for my initial orders. Over the years, i've expanded to 9 countries now including the USA.\n\nI stored everything underneath my camper in a crate pallet or tupperware, totes with a blue tarp over it. Eventually I got a small self storage unit next to the rv park lived in. Eventually, we bought a home and used the two car garage as our primary warehouse with overflow, going into multiple self storage units locally. I picked packed and shipped everything until year five (2021). Then, I moved ninety percent of everything into a 3pl partner because I don't want to run a daycare and have employees.  \n\nI didn't do any advertising or marketing or online stuff at all.And I still don't. I cold called every single commercial truck repair shop dealership college o e.M in america and a double digit percentage globally, solo over the last 9 (10 years in a couple months).\n\nThe hardest part about my business is not sales or any of that other stuff. It's managing inventory to keep up with sales volumes and cash flow.Because all manufacturing turnaround is about ninety days. If you grow at five hundred percent, you're gonna have to buy fifteen hundred percent worth of inventory.Because the timeline drag, and that's a lot of capital to have to manage and flip with a growing business. You can't have back orders or someone will just go to your competitors that you had to take them away from.",

Not to say there isn’t a book out there that lays out a specific plan for you but that knowledge likely only can be obtained by a lot of trial-error learning by you or by putting in the work to discover those currently doing it themselves.  Either way, that is the presumed price to pay to make such a large amount of money.",

You never know which one will give you an edge, and you can easily throw on audiobooks while cleaning, driving, working out, etc.\n\n\nIf you're in a position where you can work your own hours or work remotely, commit. Too many people take this as a pass to sleep in, put in fewer hours, and hope that running the numbers game on Friday afternoon will make up for piss poor production the rest of the week. It won't. For some people, it will. Assume that you won't be one of those people.\n\n\nLearn to make a friend. With everyone. You don't have to like someone, but find something to like about them. Not everyone agrees with me on this, but I learned it in timeshare, and it will help you tremendously when it comes to establishing initial rapport with people you might not want to hang around with outside of doing business with them. The over exaggeration here is that if someone kicks a puppy in front of you, you should be able to compliment the shoes they used to do it. \n\n\nOutside of that, just put in work, be honest, and crush it out there. 💪",

I used to cold call sign shops in NYC when i was starting out, got hung up on constantly but it taught me how to handle rejection and keep pushing.

Here’s the breakdown of their sales operating system:\n\n\n\n1. Pre-call qualification (this is where most teams bleed time)\n\nThey don’t let everyone book.  \nCalls only get booked if the prospect is a real fit. Qualification happens automatically through:\n\n* Smart inbound routing\n* Short VSL-style videos before booking\n* Website pages that pre-educate the buyer\n* LinkedIn connection automation for long-term nurture\n\nOutcome:  \nClosers talk only to real buyers. Time-wasters are filtered before a human ever gets involved.\n\n\n\n2. Discovery &amp; research (without manual prep)\n\nBefore every call, the rep already knows:\n\n* Funding stage\n* Company size\n* Who the real decision-maker is\n* Strategic initiatives\n* Recent hiring signals\n* Timing indicators\n\nAll of this is auto-aggregated and summarized before the call even happens.   \nSo when the rep joins, they’re already fully briefed, without spending 45 minutes digging.\n\n\n\n3. Follow-up &amp; nurturing (where most revenue is actually won)\n\nMost prospects don’t buy on the first call. Their follow-up stack runs:\n\n* Automated value-driven follow-ups\n* Personalized video follow-ups (not just text spam)\n* Multi-threading across LinkedIn to hit all stakeholders\n\nNo “just checking in.”  \nNo chasing ghosts.   \nNo pipeline rotting.\n\n\n\n4. Why this closed $966K in one month\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the leverage came from 4 things:\n\n* Only qualified buyers reach closers\n* Prospects arrive educated (less friction, faster decisions)\n* Automation removes admin from the sales cycle\n* Content warms people up before they ever talk to sales\n\n\n\nThat’s how they turned attention into real pipeline, and $966K ARR in 30 days.\n\nIf you were running this system, what would you improve or change first to squeeze out more revenue?",

Getting the first couple clients wasn't easy, but I'm getting more and more, and I'm hoping it ramps up even more the start of next year.

You're trading time for money. To get to $20K/month you'd need to either charge way more (hard market for that) or work way more hours (defeats the point of leaving your job).\n\nThe \"you'll never be wealthy as an employee\" thing is mostly BS. Plenty of people get rich with W2 jobs, especially in tech. Most small businesses don't make their owners rich either. Media companies especially are brutal margins.\n\nKeep doing it as a side hustle. If you can get to $10K/month consistently while keeping your day job, then maybe consider it. But jumping now with $3K/month and a family depending on you is risky for not much upside.\n\nBeing a good role model for your kid isn't about owning a business. It's about being present and not stressed about money all the time. Quitting a $130K job to grind 60 hours a week for maybe the same income isn't really an upgrade.\n\nNot trying to kill your dreams but the math doesn't work yet.",

Paid ads weren’t cutting it; I was spending $600-800 a month for maybe one lead.\n\nI’ve seen people talking about organic content marketing, but whenever I tried to DIY it, each post/video took half a day and results were underwhelming. A friend recommended a service from The Kaiz⁤en, run by Callum Carv⁤er. They handle strategy, editing and distribution, and I just jump on a call once a week to record.\n\nI was sceptical at first, but after about six weeks our inbound picked up. We went from 1-2 discovery calls a week to 5-6 closed three new clients in three months, and the pipeline feels steady. It’s not “set‑and‑forget”. I still have to show up, but it’s easily the best RO⁤I we’ve had. Has anyone else used them, or a similar service? Curious to hear other people's experiences.",

      "selftext": "I started this team not too long ago and we’re still small, just nine people. At first, I felt like managing others was pulling me away from actually doing the work, so I tried to get more disciplined about it. I read up on management, borrowed parts of the systems I’d seen at my previous company, and adapted them to fit our size, hoping that a bit more structure would make things feel under control.\n\nBut as the number of projects keeps growing, I’ve started to realize that the chaos isn’t just coming from team management. A lot of it is my own project management and work habits. My days are full of short meetings, Slack notifications, quick syncs, consulting calls, client updates, and random “can we jump on a call right now?”. None of these things are useless on their own, but together they completely shatter my focus.\n\nWhat really shook me was a day last week when I had seven meetings, all under 30 minutes. By the end of the day, I was exhausted, but when I tried to look back and figure out what we had actually decided, everything felt blurry. I knew I had agreed to things, but without digging through messages and notes, I couldn’t clearly remember the reasons, who owned what, or the ddl. There are just too many decisions happening every day, and it feels like my brain can’t keep up with my calendar anymore. The more tired I get, the worse my efficiency becomes.\n\nSo I wanted to ask leaders who’ve been doing this longer than I have, how do you turn all this incoming information into a system that actually works for you? How do you make sure important things don’t fall through the cracks when your work is so fragmented? I feel like I’m constantly missing things, and I’m hoping to learn how others deal with this before it burns me out completely.",

          "body": "You are definitely not alone in this. What you are describing is less about workload and more about cognitive overload. When decisions, context, and follow ups are scattered across meetings, Slack, notes, and emails, your brain becomes the system of record. That is what burns people out fast.\n\nOne thing that helped me a lot was separating “thinking” work from “capturing” work. Every meeting, call, or sync needs a single place where decisions, owners, and next steps are written down immediately. Not perfect notes, just outcomes. If it is not written, it does not exist. Over time, this alone reduces the mental load because you stop trying to remember everything.\n\nAnother big shift is limiting where work can show up. Slack, meetings, and quick calls feel harmless individually, but together they destroy focus. I started pushing everything into a small number of async updates and weekly checkpoints. Fewer meetings, but with clear agendas and clear outputs. If a meeting does not end with decisions and owners, it was not worth having.\n\nIt also helps to move from managing tasks to managing decisions. Tasks change constantly, but decisions are what actually matter. I keep a simple decision log that answers three questions: what was decided, why, and who owns the follow up. When things get blurry later, I do not have to reconstruct history from messages.\n\nFinally, give yourself permission to slow the input. Growth often adds chaos faster than systems can handle. It is okay to pause new projects, say not yet, or batch decisions. Efficiency does not come from doing more, it comes from reducing the number of things competing for attention.\n\nBurnout usually shows up when your system no longer matches the complexity of your role. Fixing the system is not a personal failure, it is leadership work.",

I decide based on impact, not noise.\n\nI ask one question first. Does this directly help me get more customers or make more money in the next 30 to 60 days? If the answer is no, it goes to later or never.\n\nEarly on, growth usually comes from a very small set of actions. Talking to your ideal customer. Improving the offer. Improving the product or service. Getting traffic. Following up with people who already showed interest. That’s it. Everything else is support work.\n\nI also cap my focus. One main goal per quarter. One main task per day. If I try to do five “important” things in a day, nothing really moves. If I do one boring but high impact thing, progress shows up.\n\nAnother rule that helps. Urgent does not mean important. Emails, DMs, tiny tweaks, tools, planning, learning more. They feel urgent because they are easy. Real growth usually feels uncomfortable and slow.\n\nIf something keeps coming up but never clearly helps growth, I ignore it without guilt. You can always add it back later when you have leverage, money, or help.\n\nYou’re not bad at balance. You’re just early and everything is loud. That’s normal. Congrats on taking action.",

After receiving it, I had some first-impression concerns and reached out to the company to talk through them and possibly return it.\n\nInstead of troubleshooting or pushing back at all, they immediately refunded me in full and told me to keep the unit. No discussion. Just “refund processed, you don’t need to send it back.”\n\nHere’s the unexpected part: after actually using it under real workload, the thing is phenomenal. Faster dry times, insane airflow, doesn’t bog down under resistance. It’s objectively better than some legacy brands I’ve used for years and clearly a serious professional tool with solid internals.\n\nAnother detail: this was the last unit they had available directly. All distributors I checked are quoting 5 to 6 week lead times on new stock.\n\nSo now I’m sitting here with a $760 piece of equipment that I didn’t pay for, is actively improving my day-to-day operations, and would easily pay for itself many times over. I didn’t ask for a comp, didn’t threaten a chargeback, didn’t exaggerate issues. I genuinely just wanted to talk through concerns and possibly return it.\n\nAs a small business owner myself, the whole situation feels… weird. Objectively, it’s a win. But it also feels morally awkward because that wasn’t my intent, and I know what margins can look like for smaller manufacturers.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen where the outcome is great, but it still feels uncomfortable? Or is this just one of those “accept the good luck and move on” situations?",

Sometimes having a boss(and it has to be the right boss) is much better tha being the boss\n\nand lastly, one thing I can say from experience(and I'm a person who has been self employeed most of my adult life)..the 5-6 years I worked for someone, I'm not complaining about my current situation. I'm happy, I'm content...but I'm also more lazy than I hsould be(though my customers and employees are ALWAYS taken care of)..look, I'm on reddit at work? That is crazy.\n\n  \nso I was a music major in college and at one time was a pretty good musician(not I'm just fine)..but one reason GREAT musicians might study with an teacher(getting private lessons) isn't because they aren't able to record themselves and hear what they did right or wrong...but rather because a teacher keeps them honest\n\n  \nI do alright. My business is sitting pretty well(of course it isn't as if I don't have concerns about what the future holds but it has been awhile since I've really been stressed out about cash flow and overall business is decent...but I'll get a little anxiety in the middle of january as this is my slow time of year and I don't lay anyone off and it is sometimes hard keeping them all busy..but anyway)\n\n  \nI'm a hard worker and I think I'm a good boss and I was a GREAT employee. That being said it doesnt' take much to convince me to take off work a little early somedays...or take a friday off. Like I said, I'll take care of all my customers and my employees but there are always things I could be doing that are more productive when it comes to growing my business. I don't put off things i HAVE to do but I could be working on a project today that would help me boost revenue. I'm giving my employees the rest of the week off(i actually do have things that they could do in Friday...but it isnt' time sensitive.\n\n  \nmy point is if I had that teacher keeping me honest and making sure I was doing some of the things that would probably benefit my business..I'd probably be selling more but times have been decent so it has been kinda easy to take that extra time off where as some people would probably keep me more on taast",

This particular factor, is not a threat. \n\nCan you imagine not just losing a sale, but losing $1,200 in shipping, on top of the $1,200 sale or, spending an additional $800 to lose a $1,200 product, trying to satisfy someone, who cannot be satisfied AND they still leave a bad review... Just because that's the type of person they are?\n\nThe product was in high demand and short supply and, I could tell which customer was going to be a pain in the ass/loss, before they even spent their money... Maybe it's not great customer service but, if I had to choose the potential customer who called once, with some basic questions, prior to purchase, who was clearly going to love and know how to use it properly, vs. the person who called 4 times, to hem and haw over how expensive it is, wasting hours of my time, demanding a discount, \"I offered you 10% off. No I cannot make shipping free. It costs $450.\n And we only charge $200,\" while having no experience with or understanding of how said product works, I know whose order I should be cancelling or, at least not digging a deeper financial hole to China, in an attempt to make them happy. \n\nThe written policy was, \"if it has been used. It is not returnable.\" We can help you fix it but, we can't fix you. Literally every person begging for a discount, had buyers remorse and wanted to return it or, insisted it was broken and unfixable... We replace it once and maybe get the original back, to find, after all the technical support and replacement demands, they never even took it out of the box.",

So we'd do 5 + 3 instead of 5 + 2. And it's still more advantageous for employers in terms of number of worked days than some current attempts at doing 4 + 3.\n\nIt could make what is now seen as weekend work worth it. So both 5-day and 3-day work weeks would become an option, instead of the vast majority of people being constrained to being busy with work on the exact same 5 days per week.\n\nMaybe it could allow students to have feasible side jobs that are more than just pocket change. Or other weekend jobs that can be more substantial in income than if they were 2 days only so are then worth it. Or, for example, one parent works 5 days, the other 3, instead of one having to stay at home during the week because childcare is too expensive to be worth it. \n\nMany things that are now closed on the weekends could be running 8/8 days if there were 3 days worth of pay available to a separate set of employees. You could then call, say, a plumber on the weekend, because some plumbers would work 5 days, others 3 days. The idea of \"weekend\" would maybe change.\n\nPeople could actually travel to places if their time off was 3 days, as 2 days is often too short to be worth it. Maybe spend some time at their parents' house outside the city. It could make places that at the moment don't have much money flowing in, flourish.\n\nCould have many benefits. And I'm not even mentioning all the mental well-being benefits.",

It's ridiculous how quickly they expect people to be 100 percent functional on a given org's systems and practices.\n\nBut yeah, if someone can't make basic decisions on their own after a robust training period, that is a different issue. It's also a problem if they don't know how to do basic problem-solving without help. Sometimes this is just a bit of a confidence issue that can be solved with coaching but... sometimes it isn't.",

So really I think it depends on the situation. \n\nThe advice I heard that I think is applicable here is to see if you as the business owner or boss are doing everything *YOU* should be doing to help the employee succeed. Essentially there are 4 things you should be doing. If you are doing all those things and the job is still not getting done, then it's time for them to go.\n\nThe four things you should be doing are ensuring they know what you want them to do, how to do the thing you want them to do, when that thing should be done by, and removing any obstacles that stop them from doing the thing.\n\n##1. What\nHaving a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities. If they don't know  what their role is and the responsibilities that come with it, they'll never be able to perform adequately. Clearly communicate the tasks they are responsible for completing.\n\n##2. How\nOnce they know their duties, confirm they know how to complete the job. For entry and mid level positions, SOPs are how you can give step-by-step instructions without having to constantly be present. For higher level positions that require more advanced or a larger variety of skills, and honestly most small business positions, training takes longer to get them familiar with how *your* business operates, or you're paying them enough to already come on with those skills already developed.\n\n##3. When\nIf they know what to do and how to do it, and it's still not getting done, then confirm they know the timeline. Tell them by when or how often they should be completing tasks. If you've told them once, remind them. You may not need to train them more, just a gentle reminder.\n\n##4. Obstacles\nIf they know what to do, how to do it, and when to have completed it, but it's still not getting done, check to see there isn't something external stopping them. The classic example is telling a chef you want a simple omelette for breakfast this morning and there being no eggs in your house/restaurant. Clearly despite the skills the chef has and the communication of your expectations, they won't be able to do it. Maybe the employee has an issue and they don't feel like they have the authority to \"fix\" the problem. Either fix it for them, go buy the eggs, or give them the authority and guidelines to fix it themselves.\n\nIf you as a business owner aren't making sure that your employees have everything they need to succeed, then you are failing your business in that respect.     \nSure, you may just have a bad hire, but that's also your fault for not vetting properly. Both management and hiring are skills you need to develop though, so it makes sense to suck at first.",

The employees need to learn it the company way before deviating. While they get hired for a specific skill set, that skill set alone will not give them the knowledge of our process. After they know the process, the goal is to set them free of supervision. Some people can't handle this kind of supervision, however, if the process is followed and someone else has to take over, they can look at the parts and know exactly how to finish WITHOUT asking question and produce a finished part that passes QC.",

          "body": "It depends on what you're micromanaging.\n\nIf you have to micromanage to get effort or inputs from an employee, just fire them. Tell them once. Maybe twice. Then gone. You shouldn't have to micromanage activity. If they're not willing to try their best, they aren't worth your effort. They will likely never change.\n\nIf you have to \"micromanage\" for quality or results (that's not micromanaging - it's training), it's often trainable as long as the effort and desire is there. There's an element of whether someone has the potential to succeed, but the truth is that most everything can be trained. Then, you have to decide whether the gap is small enough that you're willing to invest in bridging it. You should account for vacancy costs, hiring costs, and risk of new employee failure in that case. It's pretty high in some fields and VERY high in others (e.g. sales). The greater the complexity of the job, the more you should expect to train for quality and results.\n\nIf you're expecting to hire someone and for them to instantly be plug and play, then you're the problem and you shouldn't be managing people. That's not how it works for 99.9% of the population. Very few people have the tools to set themselves up for success in a new role and/or a new company.\n\nHire and fire for attitudes. Hire and train for skills. That philosophy will never fail you.",

Our BCBS rates are going up to 2400 a month with no pre-existing conditions.  The subsidies have expired.  We didn't renew by the Dec 15 in hopes something would get done in Congress because we can still enroll by Jan 15th.  I just do not understand how Health insurance with huge deductibles can actually cost 2400 for 2 people.  My mother who is 76 and lives with me because she has late stage Alzheimers pays 280 a month with Aetna because she was civil service and Federal government subsidizes her healthcare.  She doesnt get Medicare because she didnt pay enough into it but at 280 a month, she is good.  This entire system is a joke.  I feel like I am being punished or farmed.\n\nMy question is what are some other options?  Maybe just catastrophic insurance and then Primary care use cash.  We are trying to save to retire but with Homeowners insurance going up every year as well as Auto insurance and now this.  Its simply unsustainable.\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to add a very weird fact to this all.  One of the many reason i have no trust in insurance companies.  A few years ago Humana pulled out of our county and we had to change insurance providers.  We ask why but in short the reason was they lost money or the zone we live wasnt profitable, blah blah.  The irony when I saw them place 400 piece order with our gift shop later that month.  They obviously are not hurting on money",

Your medical conditions don't matter anymore because of you are on an ACA plan. The older you are, the higher the cost. Men are more expensive than women because they have more medical issues the older they get. The insurance companies in the United States exist to make money, so they price everything accordingly. \n\nThe price they come up with for insurance coverage whether you have an ACA plan from the marketplace, a plan from your employer, or even Medicaid and Medicare is the same. The price is the price. \n\nWhat you pay then depends on how much your employer covers, how much the government pays (ACA subsidies or medicaid or medicare). Insurance companies are raising their prices because the cost of healthcare continues to skyrocket and Republicans have decided that they don't want the government to pay for the ACA subsidies anymore, so individuals like your have to pay full price now, which is statistically higher than ever before.\n\nI used to work in insurance and honestly, the catastrophic plans are a scam and really difficult to navigate for someone who is not versed in their exclusions. You could get a private non ACA plan that will look at your medical history to get you approved, that is more affordable than your current plan, but it is not as comprehensive. There's a lot more to explain on how that works, but hopefully you get the gist. \n\nMy recommendation is to just eat the cost and stay fully insured. Being in your 50s with a business and a spouse to worry about, it;s not worth the risk .",

No early warning signs, just healthy one day, and sick the next.\n\nSome people are brining up the tired trope of \"Just go uninsured if you don't have assets.\" People who talk about it as if Medical Debt is the only worry have never been through a serious illness. There is a huge gulf between the care a hospital is required to provide you and the care an insurance company will provide you.\n\nMost cancer treatment is not \"the ER has to treat you\" care. And even if a hospital is going to provide you with the bare minimum and bill you/settle later, that may not be enough to give you the best chance of long life or quality of life. There are all kinds of high-ticket items that are technically not *necessary* and you don't get those without insurance.\n\nNeulasta shots to keep white blood cells up during chemo: &gt;$10k EACH (I had four, some people need 20)  \nBreast reconstruction surgery: 6 figures (I'll need at least 2)  \nCDK 4/6 inhibitors to prevent breast cancer recurrence: &gt;$10k/month for 2-3 years  \nPET Scans to check for metastatic spread: $10k\n\nJust a few examples. Insured people get to worry about authorizations for those services and medications. Uninsured people don't get them at all.\n\nIf you have to compromise, get the cheapest ACA plan offered you and adjust your budget. Any insurance is better than being uninsured.

It did affect me and our customers when the tardy types were 1-8 minutes late. It wasn’t horrible, but it was annoying.\n\nThe owners tried all kinds of things. Some were clever, some were punitive, some were incentives, they even tried something illegal, until that got shut down. Nothing worked. There was always at least one person late, every single day. And usually 2 or 3, out of staff of about 25. And it was always one or more of the same 8 or so people showing up late. Nothing worked.\n\nFinally, the owner gave up, and quietly approached the half dozen or so of us who were always on time or early, and just asked us to deal with it. For a price. Here, Uncle, here’s a $50 gift card. Hey, a vendor gave me this nice bottle of bourbon, but I don’t drink. You take it. Oh, she needs to leave two hours early today for a doctor’s appointment? We’ll just overlook that and pay her for the entire day. Hey Bob, these widgets aren’t selling, and you mentioned how nice they were. Why don’t you remove them from inventory as a store expense and take them home?\n\nThat was a pretty good system, because the people who were conscientious felt taken care of, and the people who were always late didn’t feel like they were constantly getting in trouble.

There’s no silver bullet, and this conversation often raises more questions than answers.\n\nThe first thing to look at is the nature of the job. In roles where timing is critical, like childcare, customer facing coverage, or safety related positions, being on time is not optional. If coverage is impacted, then the expectation is clear: being late isn’t acceptable (PERIOD).\n\nOn the other hand, there are roles where output, collaboration, and results matter far more than watching the clock. In many tech and knowledge based jobs, no one is tracking minutes as long as the work gets done and you are not bottleneck.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is fairness and morale. When some employees consistently arrive late while others are dependable and punctual, it can quietly erode trust, even if the actual impact on operations is small. That’s usually the real issue, not the 1–8 minutes themselves.\n\nFor me, the balance is setting clear expectations based on the role, applying them consistently, and addressing patterns early in a respectful, private way, before small issues turn into resentment.",

Good for budget printing.  \n\\- Mo⁤o - Better quality than VistaPrint but more expensive, around $30-40 for 250. Worth it if you want premium feel but sounds like you're looking for cheap.  \n\\- Go⁤tPrint - Similar pricing to VistaPrint, decent quality. Bulk discounts are okay but nothing special.  \n\\- Mo⁤bilo - Digital option that's honestly cheaper long-term. One-time cost instead of reprinting every time. Lead tracking and analytics included. If you're tired of the printing loop, this makes sense.  \n\\- Ca⁤nva Print - Integrated with Canva if you design there. Pricing is middle-ground, around $25-30 for 250.

Quality is fine for basic networking purposes. Moo is better quality but more expensive so skip them unless you're trying to impress.\n\nDigital cards are honestly underrated and I'd lean that way for most situations now. A simple link in your email signature or a QR code on your phone works for 90% of interactions. With our clients we've noticed physical cards mostly end up in a drawer or trash anyway while a LinkedIn connection actually leads somewhere.\n\nIf you do need physical cards for events or industries where they're expected, Canva has a print service that's cheap and lets you design without paying a designer. Or just order the absolute minimum quantity since your info will probably change within a year anyway.\n\nThe hundred dollar quote from local shops is insane unless they're doing letterpress or some fancy finish.

People want to quickly see what you do, where you are, and whether you feel legit. \n\nRelying only on social media is risky since you do not own those platforms. Algorithms change, reach drops, and accounts can get suspended. At least with a website you own your reputation and always have a place to send people to. Plus,local search actually works if the site is optimized.",

I had a website, fb business page, LinkedIn, and Houzz, for the 18 years I was in business.  I got  exactly one client off of one of the free platforms. Most of my vendors required a website for opening a reseller account.  So, did I need one, yes. Did it help me get any business, no. I thrived on word of mouth and had very loyal clients that I built relationships with in the 18 years I worked for another company. No I didn't steal any clients. The company closed their doors 4 months after I left, which of course I knew that was coming. \n\nI kept my philosophy  (that I learned, at the age of 21 from a very wise boss, who didn't scoff at me when he asked during my interview where I wanted to be in 5 years and I told him.) of giving the most dependable and knowledgeable service as possible, at the core of my company's mission statement. The clients could get the same products elsewhere but not the same level of service and industry knowledge that I had. I knew I needed to have a niche and there was nothing better than word of mouth. I got clients that were willing to pay for quality, because they saw what I did for others and asked for me. So for b2b, in a small town (pop. 160,000), I definitely did not need a website to get business. All that to say, being distinguished in your field is more important than anything else.\n\nI believe in a much higher population a website would have been useful. I spent way too much money and time on my beautifully visual and professional website. If I knew what I know now, I would just have a one page simple website. Saved some money and a LOT of time. I worked really hard on my website through all 18 years. Really, it was just a money pit. I had to continuously pay more for add-ons and tech support to keep the site running properly. That was in addition to all the other yearly fees.  Well, that doesn't work because you need to buy this other add-on. It never ended.",

In return, you gain control, stability, and long-term value. Most importantly, you gain intelligence. When you own your website, you own the data. You can see who’s visiting, what they care about, how they convert, and where opportunities are being missed. That insight is very difficult to get when you rely solely on rented platforms like social media or third-party marketplaces.\n\nOver time, that intelligence compounds. It allows you to improve messaging and offers, understand customer behavior, optimize marketing spend, and build a durable brand.\n\nSo while a website may not be required for your small business, it is critical for greater success.

So literally our website is just a landing page that mostly redirects visitors to parts of our POS system and has some About Me sections.

I did have Instagram and Facebook business pages but tried giving those up in January in an effort to improve my mental health and getting off social media. Our store sales plummeted within weeks.

I am using it the same way small businesses have always used better tools, as a force multiplier that lets me do more with the same amount of time and energy.\n\nAI does not run my business. I do. It helps me draft, research, summarize, sanity check ideas, and move faster through the boring parts so I can spend more time on the work that actually matters. Talking to customers. Making decisions. Building relationships. If anything, it gives me back time to be more human, not less.\n\nThe fear that we will forget how to do things ourselves assumes people blindly outsource their brains. That is a choice, not a requirement. Calculators did not kill math. Spreadsheets did not kill accounting. Email did not kill communication. The people who understand the tool and keep their skills sharp are the ones who benefit. The ones who abdicate responsibility get weaker, and that has always been true with or without AI.\n\nAs for cost and dependency, small businesses already rely on software, platforms, utilities, and vendors every single day. The difference is that AI finally gives small operators leverage that used to require staff or agencies. That is empowering, not dystopian.\n\nIf someone feels overwhelmed by AI hype, the answer is not to reject it outright. The answer is to use it intentionally. AI should make me more capable, not replace me. When used correctly, it is not a crutch. It is a power tool.\n\nA couple of really helpful non-techie books that I like that cover AI are:\n\n“Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/49imjL8\n\n\n“Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future”\n\nhttps://amzn.to/493PobQ",

It’s absolutely not worth it and has made me reconsider my business relationship with this company. \n\nAdditionally, people should know for a fact that the actual cost of these tools is likely drastically underpriced. Using it is akin to eating a poisoned apple, with a lot of issues down the line. All the companies restructuring around AI will likely find that there will be no company after a few years, because this kind of experience I have will likely become more common as time goes by.",

People are entering the work force less educated and more illiterate. They're also demanding more while their performance is less than average. People are expecting high wages when they lack qualifications and performance history.  Nowadays Young people are having a hard time following phone scripts.

We are beginning to see this as the cost of goods outpace the ability to purchase them. What happens when there is nobody left with any discretionary spending money?\n\nUnfortunately, small businesses are going to disproportionately bear the brunt of this because they often depend on their customers' discretionary spending ability; think nail salons, hair salons, spas, saunas, bars, pizza places, etc. Small businesses in the B2B sector will also feel the pain when their customers, often the owners of the these nail salons, restaurants, and bars close their businesses or elect to take on additional responsibilities to save money. So small businesses that offer financial, legal, and technical services close their doors without customers.

We range from a slim 7 employees to maybe 12-15 during busier times. We don’t quite make the revenue you do. I make like 90k a year in Fairfield county CT. I do think the position should pay a little more but I really do like the job (or I wouldn’t have made it 14+ years!) and I manage the financials so I know there’s not really a room to pay me much more. I have a stream of benefits that add about 5-10k a year in non-taxable ways. No benefits (I’m not mad, we can get them with my wife’s work and it’s very costly for a small business.)\n\nI would say 100k is a nice round number, but it also depends on what benefits you offer.  \n\nI’m happy to discuss this more via a private message if you want more insight! ",

Nowhere in the comments I have seen what your gross profit is, what your occupancy costs are, licensing costs (you mentioned some of your products were discontinued due to legality so I’m guessing this is some kind of supplement or CBD or cannabis operation), etc.  there’s a lot more to ownership beyond what you’ve described, so more info would be useful to evaluate. I’m guessing you started 13 years ago and your pay hasn’t grown with experience. But retail is a funny space and lots of retail managers are punching above their weight in terms of responsibility and compensation so it’s not that easy to jump from one role to another.  Like someone said elsewhere, a $1-$2M operation is wildly different than a $7-$9M operation.  I’ll add that being in downtown LA is wildly different than somewhere like, say, Madera County.  Ultimately, if you feel underpaid, pull the financials and ask for more.  If you want us to suggest a fair compensation we can’t do that without more details.",

Doesn't matter what the gross revenue is, doesn't matter what the net revenue is either. Most people often miss the supply and demand of labor markets and just how integral the owner thinks you are. Nothing is stated about you other than your current position. Do you hold any licenses, certificates, degrees, that make you less replaceable? Do you believe, in the owner's perspective, you are indispensable not because of your chatbot bullets but with your responsiveness, proactivity, the relationships you build? Doesn't matter what you think do they view it that way? If you do not hold any specialized licenses or certifications, if you started looking elsewhere are there jobs available with what you are looking for? And more. The only thing that matters is they pay you minimum wage and treat you in line with labor laws.  The cost of living doesn't matter, the location doesn't matter, random numbers being thrown out without context is ridiculous.\n\nNow, let's assume you don't just do those tasks but you are indispensable. You do all of those tasks and do them better than most people with a similar resume as you. You hustle and have been a driver of the growth. You deal with employee relations and have some level of decision making power and do it all well. You are basically acting as a chief operating officer and an exceptional one. Without you it would crumble. Then the \"avg\" package doesn't apply. If you are integral and basically run the day to day, they should give you a package and treat you in a way you never want to leave, especially if you have other options. They need to realize without you, that work will fall all on them in addition to their business operating responsibilities, be spread out amongst the other employees likely burning them out, or  be completed by someone else, or the other employees, way below your abilities and quality.  They are fools to not have already been doing this if this is truly the case. There is a chance you view yourself as more important than they do or you are fairly replaceable but just going on what you said, they should be compensating you as much as feasible to keep you. That being said, all of those tasks, done in a mediocre manner just make you middle management in retail, easily replaceable. Reflect on your value and request a conversation. If you were my key employee I'd piss myself knowing your value and thinking you were even remotely feeling underpaid/undervalued or considering looking elsewhere. Good luck.",

A few stand out clearly.\n\nAI-enabled services for small and medium businesses will grow quickly. Not flashy AI startups burning cash, but practical automation. Things like customer support, bookings, quoting, finance admin, compliance, marketing, and internal tools. The winners will be the ones that package AI in a simple, trustworthy way and actually save time or money. The big challenge here is trust, data quality, and not overpromising. People are already tired of AI solves everything nonsense.\n\nHealthcare, wellbeing, and ageing-related services are going to explode. Populations are ageing, public healthcare systems are under pressure, and people are more willing to pay privately than ever before. This includes remote monitoring, home care, mental health support, preventative health, and assistive tech. The challenge is regulation, ethics, and delivering real outcomes rather than just apps and subscriptions that don’t move the needle.\n\nCybersecurity and digital trust businesses will grow steadily. As everything moves online and AI makes scams and attacks more convincing, security becomes a non-negotiable cost, not a nice to have. Small businesses are especially vulnerable and under-protected. Growth here will favour firms that simplify security and education, not those that rely on fear. \n\nNiche e-commerce and specialist brands will continue to outperform big generic retailers. People are happy to buy from smaller brands if they feel understood and looked after. This works best where there’s expertise, curation, or a strong story, not just cheaper prices. The challenge is margins, logistics, and not being crushed by ad costs. Community and repeat customers matter more than scale.\n\nEducation and reskilling businesses will grow, especially outside traditional institutions. People know that one career for life is gone. Short, practical learning that leads directly to better income or flexibility will win. This could be technical skills, business skills, or even trades done in smarter ways. The challenge is credibility. Too many courses overpromise and underdeliver, so trust and real-world results are everything.\n\nLocal services that use technology well will quietly do very well. Repair, installation, logistics, home services, and specialist maintenance aren’t going away. Businesses that layer tech, automation, and good customer experience on top of boring but necessary work will be hard to compete with.",

As a franchise expert, I’m constantly looking at these exact trends to see where the \"smart money\" is moving.\n\nIf we look at the next 5–10 years, I see three specific areas that aren't just growing, they're becoming essential:  \n  \nSenior Care &amp; \"Age-in-Place\" Services: With the aging population (Boomers), there is a massive surge in demand for in-home care, senior moving services, and home modifications. It’s a very resilient sector because it’s a necessity, not a luxury.  \nEco-Maintenance &amp; Green Energy: It's no longer just about solar panels. Businesses focusing on EV charging station installation, battery storage, and \"green\" home services (like eco-friendly insulation or HVAC) are going to explode as infrastructure catches up with climate goals.  \nHealth &amp; Personalized Wellness: We’re moving away from \"big box\" gyms toward boutique, specialized health concepts—things like IV hydration, longevity clinics, and tech-enabled mental health services. People are willing to pay a premium for health \"optimization\" rather than just basic fitness.\n\nThe biggest challenge? It’s definitely going to be **labor**. Finding and keeping quality people is the hurdle every business owner faces right now. That’s why systems and automation are so huge, the businesses that win will be the ones that use technology to make their human staff more efficient.\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be building.

I get way more pleasure from that than regular social media. \n\nI take a lunch break, read and take a short nap on days that I can. \n\nI break for dinner in the evening to spend time with my wife. \n\nInstead of working late into the night which is much less productive work time, i make lists for the next day(s). \n\nI keep a document open on my desktop for future plans and ideas to improve my company. \n\nInstead of scrolling when I go to bed I like to just lay there and think and let my mind wander.

Fixed work hours, a short daily task list, and a clear definition of what a good day looks like. When the rules are set in advance, you don’t have to feel like working to do the work.\n\nI also separate thinking from doing. I decide what matters when I’m calm, then execute when I’m tired, bored, or doubtful. No re-deciding mid-day. That alone removes a lot of friction.\n\nAnother thing that helped was tying work to consequences. If I don’t do the work, money doesn’t come in. If money doesn’t come in, stress follows. I stopped trying to sugarcoat that reality and used it as fuel.\n\nLoneliness is real in solo work, so I build artificial accountability. Weekly targets, public commitments, or even just sending progress updates to someone I respect. You don’t need a team, you need a mirror.\n\nSome days still feel flat. That doesn’t mean you’re failing. Most real progress happens on days where nothing feels exciting. If you can keep working through those, you’re already ahead.\n\nMotivation is a bonus.

My wife went through 5 or 6 different baby tracking apps (tracking diaper changes, sleep, feeds, etc...). roughly $20/month in subscriptions to do everything she wanted. I was working as a senior user experience designer and she said to me, is there anyway you can get all of this into one app and make it much cheaper. I gave it a try and boom, the birth of the solo-entrepreneur. I could do the User experience work, but then came learning to code, learning to make a backend, learning how to get on the app stores. How to sync data across ios and android. I have been working on this for almost two years now and it's almost done. What keeps me motivated is that what I'm doing has never been done before and I know that it will do well. I have faith in what I have done and if this can give me financial freedom to spend more time with my family that will make all the work worth it. \n\n  \nP.S. if you want to see what I have done go check it out [binxbabycare.com](http://binxbabycare.com)",

      "selftext": "The automation works by connecting Google Sheet and Gmail. Once an hour, a script checks your inbox for new reservation emails and automatically pulls out the guest's name and contact info (and tags the email as \"processed\").  \nThen, every morning, it looks through that list to find everyone who visited the day before and sends them a friendly email asking how their visit went, along with a direct link to leave a review.\n\nSo far it works pretty well. One-third of the recipients left a review. This was a low-hanging fruit so I don't know why I didn't do it earlier.\n\nLimitation: so far this solution only works, if your reservations arrive in email (in our case they are from a WordPress site (booking plugins like Contact Form 7 or WPForms)), and you use Gmail. If you want to replicate it, I'll leave the step-by-step descrtiption in the comments.",

I do have enough savings to get by, but the overthinking still kicks in, especially at night. I am continuing to invest in advertising, and I have a strong online presence with good reviews and solid creatives, so the slowdown has been a bit discouraging and confusing.\n\nI am based in Texas, in the U.S., so I am especially curious if others in similar markets are seeing the same thing and how you usually handle slower periods.\n\nAppreciate any insight or shared experiences.

I advertise and bring in new customers but many of my regular customers are spending less now. My year started off very strong, I've got a great product and my key demographic are younger people without children that usually have more discretionary spending. Talking to other vendors, it's that way for everyone from the farmers to the crafters and hot food vendors. My business is a dog bakery. I feel so bad when I see the dogs I know wanting to run over to me but the owners trying to quickly guide them away. Some of them have told me recently they have to watch their spending so they are rationing the treats. I told them to come by and let their dogs get my samples regardless of whether or not they can buy anything. The dogs don't understand keeping a budget. I know they'll buy again when they can. The way things have been going, I'm having to scale back the business to only the weekends and focus on regular work as a web developer and digital marketing - the bakery will just be a hobby business going forward. Fortunately, I am finding some work with digital marketing so I can make it work - this takes the pressure off of the bakery being my sole source of income. Now I can just enjoy being out in the community, getting to know my customers and making doggos happy.",

When people reach out worried about a slowdown, the first thing I usually look at isn't ads or reviews, it's whether traffic and inquiries actually dropped across the board or if it's mainly new leads that slowed. Those are very different signals.   \n  \nA seasonal pause in new demand is common, especially toward year end, and it can feel scary even when the underlying setup hasn't changed.

It used to be that mods were sharp about removing obvious spam and low effort promotion, but lately, it feels like more of it is just getting waved through. I keep seeing blatant review spam posted here, and what makes it worse is that it’s clearly getting fake upvotes and scripted comments to push it to the top.\n\nThis place has been a great resource for me, but allowing this much noise to slip through is a recipe for the community to go from great to worse very quickly. When the feed is cluttered with obvious manipulation, it makes the whole subreddit look unprofessional and eventually drives away the experienced founders who actually provide the best value. I’m curious if the rest of the 1k+ people browsing right now are noticing the same shift or if it’s just me. I’d hate to see us lose the quality that's built here, but it feels like the signal is getting lost in the noise and the moderation needs to be much tighter to protect the sub’s future.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for advice from small convenience store owners or anyone who’s dealt with a similar situation.\n\nMy dad owns a small, family-run convenience store. The entrance is very narrow — only one person can pass through at a time. Recently, a homeless man who appears to be an addict has been repeatedly hanging around the front door and blocking the entrance.\n\nYesterday, the situation escalated badly. When my dad asked him to leave and move away from the entrance, the man refused and stood in the doorway shouting and screaming for about 10 minutes straight. He was making obscene gestures (including repeatedly pointing at his genitals), yelling aggressively, and would not leave despite repeated requests.\n\nAt one point, he appeared to aim toward the window as if he might break it. My dad raised his voice and asked him not to. The man then made explicit death threats, repeatedly gesturing slitting/stabbing motions at his neck and threatening to kill my dad. This continued for several minutes.\n\nTwo passersby eventually stopped and helped by yelling at the man until he finally left. My dad even pretended to call the police at one point, but it had no effect. We have videos of the incident, and it’s honestly disturbing. For context, my dad is in his late 60s, and the business is in West Hollywood blvd, Los Angeles. \n\nWhat’s more concerning is that this wasn’t a one-time event:\n\n\t•\tThe man showed up earlier that morning and again later in the evening\n\n\t•\tOne time, my dad gave him a box of biscuits and asked him to leave, and he did\n\n\t•\tBut later that night, he returned and became aggressive again\n\n\t•\tHe seems to be a regular presence in the area and keeps coming back\n\nTo be clear: this is not about being anti-homeless or refusing help to people in need. The issue is that he repeatedly blocks the entrance, refuses to move or leave, becomes verbally aggressive, and has now made direct violent threats.\n\nMy concern is safety — especially if he comes back and follows through on those threats.\n\nMy questions:\n\n\t•\tWhat is the appropriate course of action in a situation like this- when it becomes threatening?\n\n\t•\tIs calling the police the only realistic option, or are there other steps that help?\n\n\t•\tHow do you handle this in a way that protects the business and the people inside without escalating things?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be really appreciated.",

          "body": "The recommendations to call the police are right, but in LA you have to be realistic and know the police may or may not actually help.  Still do this.\n\nMeantime, make your business as unattractive as possible for homeless people.  Do not EVER feed, give drinks or allow them to charge their phones at your business.  You're not being kind, you're establishing that you are their new favorite hangout place.  This is bad.  If you want to be charitable, do that by donating to the shelter or other services that happen away from your store.  Make sure all outside electrical outlets and hose spigots are locked.\n\nWhile you should never, ever physically assault anyone, you can also make the environment less hospitable.  Install an outdoor speaker for music.  Next time someone is hanging out in the doorway blocking it, turn on the music to an uncomfortable level.  Play something annoying.  Your choice - Baby Shark, classical, jazz, whatever you think might be annoying.\n\nMany of the homeless people are paranoid.  Install outdoor cameras even if the cameras are fake or don't record.  Make sure the camera is obvious - a blinking red light is helpful here.  Have signs up that say the area is under video surveillance.  If possible, have a recording you can play when needed.  Something like \"You are being monitored.\"  \n\nKeep the outside and front of your store spotless.  Pick up every speck of trash.  Although it has a subtle effect, people are more inclined to gravitate to the setting where they fit in.  The types of customers you want will feel more comfortable in the clean setting and the types of people you don't want will feel out of place.  \n\nIf this homeless person returns, you may want to hire a security guard temporarily.  You just want to move this person along a few times and break them of the habit of coming to your store.  Encourage them to find other sources of biscuits and shelter.",

Police are required to respond.\n\nIf language is a barrier, the dispatcher can access interpretation services.\n\n🏪 Important legal point (this helps the owner)\n* A storefront is private property\n* The owner has the right to refuse service\n* Once the person is told to leave and does not, it becomes trespassing\n* Obscene conduct and blocking an entrance are citable offenses\n* The owner does not need to argue, explain, or negotiate.\n\n📞 If the situation is disruptive but not immediately dangerous: \n* Use Los Angeles Police Department non-emergency:\n📞 877-ASK-LAPD (877-275-5273)\n\nThis is appropriate if:\n* The person is yelling but not threatening\n* Customers are scared or leaving\n* The behavior keeps recurring\n\n🧭 Additional LA support (after the incident): \n\nOnce police address the immediate issue, the owner can also report ongoing problems to:\n* LA Sanitation (for encampment-related issues)\n* LAHSA (outreach follow-up)\n\n⚠️ These do not replace calling police when someone is actively causing a disturbance.\n\n❌ What the owner should not do: \n\n* Do not physically intervene\n* Do not argue or reason with the person\n* Do not feel guilty for calling police\n* Do not wait “to see if it gets better”\n\nThis is especially important given age and language barriers.\n\n💡 Practical steps to reduce future risk\n\nIf this is a recurring issue:\n\n* Post “Private Property / No Loitering” signage\n* Keep doors locked during disturbances\n* Have a neighbor or nearby business aware and ready to call\n* Document dates/times (helps police act faster next time)\n\n❤️ A note on compassion (without self-endangerment): \n\nCalling police is not anti-homeless.\nIt is pro-safety.\n\nPolice can:\n* Remove the person from the property\n* Call mental health or outreach teams\n* Prevent escalation that could hurt the owner or others\n~~~~~\n\nA couple other things that might help:  * Get to know the neighboring ship owners. I guarantee you they're dealing with the same things. Your dad might be intimidated because he doesn't speak English, so maybe you introduce yourself first. Simple omemade goodies or a small tin of swedish butter cookies from the store can be a great ice breaker, especially this week during Christmas. For you and your dad, aways smiling and simply say Hi to the neighbors is also a great icebreaker. Even if they aren't friendly at first, eventually they'll come around because they'll remember you guys as the smiling neighbors. \n\n* Give your dad a simple script he can use in English to say to the person blocking the door in case they return: \n(From chatgpt again:\n\n“This is private property.\nYou must leave now.”\n\nIf they do not leave or continue yelling:\n“If you do not leave, I will call the police.”\n\nThen stop speaking and make the call if it continues. \n\n📞 Script for calling 911\n“I own a store.\nThere is a man blocking my entrance.\nHe is yelling and being obscene.\nI am afraid.”\n\nIf needed:\n“I do not speak English well. I need an interpreter.”\n\nThat is enough. You do not need details.\n\n📞 Script for LAPD non-emergency (if not violent)\n\n“There is a man refusing to leave my store entrance.\nHe is yelling and disturbing customers.\nThis is private property.”\n\nNumber: 877-275-5273\n\n🧠 Important reminders for the owner\n* Say it once only\n* Stay inside if possible\n* Do not argue\n* Do not touch the person\n* Calling police is the correct action\n~~~~\n\nI hope this helps him! \n\nIf you'd like the chatgpt prompts i used, in glad to share. \n\nI wish you and your dad the best!",
